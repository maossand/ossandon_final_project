Egyptian Lover,“I Cry (Night After Night)”,1984,"The original 808s and heartbreak. ""I Cry (Night After Night)"" might not be Egyptian Lover's most famous anthem (that would be ""Egypt Egypt""), but it remains one of Greg Broussard's most influential. Absent is the Egyptian iconography that situated the Californian DJ/producer/rapper/electro pioneer's early-'80s output squarely in the realm of Afrofuturism while also giving it the faintest whiff of novelty; in its place is the musical equivalent of crying into your pillow after eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's. With ""I Cry (Night After Night)"", Egyptian Lover not only paved the way for the sad robot music that the likes of Kanye West and Future would go on to push farther and into weirder territory, he also helped establish a trope that rappers still employ to this day: the sad-sack confessional that humanizes their bulletproof tough-guy persona, or in Lover's case, his gift-to-womankind lothario status. True to form, he manages to retain a sliver of his egomania even in his darkest hour, claiming his ""Egyptian voice will hypnotize."" After three decades of being entranced by he of the magnificent bouffant, maybe it's time we concede the point. —Renato Pagnani",Nave Maria,200,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Tom Zé,“Nave Maria”,1984,"In the late '60s, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil invited Tom Zé to join the Tropicálistas and light a fire under Brazil’s military dictatorship. Often, the movement’s musical element wed exuberant, traditionally Brazilian sounds with a rock'n'roll pose and jarring descriptions of political violence and social unrest; Zé, a firebrand among revolutionaries, was particularly concerned with the folly of ""globarbarization."" When Tropicália lost the war, Zé sojourned into experimentalism, and in 1984, six years after his previous full-length, he released a revelatory electric opus called Nave Maria. It sold like cold cakes, and the 48-year-old, either too broke or heartbroken to continue, made plans to work at his brother’s gas station.",Nave Maria,199,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
A Certain Ratio,“Shack Up”,1980,"Manchester’s A Certain Ratio followed the post-punk dictum of finding common ground between contrasting styles. On ""Shack Up"", they landed on a magnetic three-way split between funk, old soul, and the long-raincoat gloom of their hometown labelmates Joy Division. Originally released on the Factory Benelux offshoot partly formed by Ian Curtis’s girlfriend Annik Honoré, ""Shack Up"" came out in the same year (1980) as Dexys Midnight Runners’ ""Geno"" and resembles the bloodless flip side to Kevin Rowland’s unwavering passion. ACR singer Simon Topping emotes in a gray monotone, similar to Ian Curtis, while drummer Donald Johnson, who had arrived the previous year, brings a funky danceability to the song that Factory would explore even further with the emergence of the Happy Mondays later in the decade. But what makes ""Shack Up"" a classic is its ultra-sparse atmosphere, making it feel like ACR were stripping something to its core principles, in the process burrowing to the very core of what makes certain styles tick. —Nick Neyland",Love Byrd,198,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
"Donald Byrd / 125th Street, N.Y.C.",“Love Has Come Around”,1981,"Arriving after the disco bubble had already popped, Donald Byrd & 125th Street, N.Y.C.’s ""Love Has Come Around"" is as optimistic as they come. By the '80s, Byrd, an accomplished jazz/funk trumpeter who also taught at North Carolina Central University, had moved to Elektra after a long run on Blue Note and formed a new band that included students from his classes. The group’s second album, 1981’s Love Byrd, saw them teaming up with producer Isaac Hayes, who offered slick production chops as well as his quartet of backup singers, Hot Buttered Soul Unlimited. Hayes turned the band’s well-oiled grooves into one of the loveliest singles of the late-disco period, building a plush arrangement of piano, layered harmonies, moody bass, and Byrd’s own effervescent trumpet detailing. Decried at the time by jazz purists as a cheap bid for popular relevance, ""Love Has Come Around"" today sounds like a perfect bridge between classic soul and the last gasps of lavishly arranged dance music, soon to be eclipsed by house’s love affair with turntables and drum machines. —Abigail Garnett",Love Byrd,197,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Dinosaur L,“Go Bang! #5 (Francois K Mix)”,1986,"Arthur Russell saw no reason to erect a barrier between the music he performed on his cello at the Kitchen, an artsy downtown performance space, and his records that got played at discotheques like the Gallery and the Paradise Garage. He was hardly alone in wanting to eradicate the boundaries between fine art and pop art; that was a principal belief in the 1980s, particularly within New York's avant-garde milieu of musicians and video artists and graffiti writers and experimental poets. But while noise and classical minimalism were deemed acceptable bedfellows, few downtown types extended that open-mindedness to the city's discotheques, where a mostly gay crowd, many of them black and Latino, were conducting their own experiments in repetition, extreme duration, and altered states.",24→24 Music,196,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Jungle Brothers,“Straight Out the Jungle”,1988,"By the late '80s, rap was thinking big, entering a golden age that produced maximalist, sample-dense classics like It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, 3 Feet High and Rising, Paul’s Boutique, and Tougher Than Leather. Each of those records was risky and expensive, the product of artists not only with ambitious visions but also the budget to realize them. The Jungle Brothers didn’t have those kinds of resources, though, when they recorded their debut Straight Out the Jungle, released in 1988 on the no-profile independent label Warlock Records. It was the first true masterpiece of the jazz-rap movement, but compared to some of the more sophisticated albums that followed in its footsteps, it’s almost crude.",It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,195,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Too $hort,“Freaky Tales”,1987,"For a supposedly delicate art form, people get haiku poetry confused. It’s not all dragonflies on blades of grass: many of the earliest haikus were dick puns and otherwise crude wandering-poet bro humor. It was juvenile, maybe, but not for its own sake—it complemented the reality-grounded, borderline mundane writing style. All the power lies within the extreme, barely-editorialized brevity, capturing and presenting a real life moment with the purest, most direct translation possible. On ""Freaky Tales"", the centerpiece of East Bay icon Too $hort’s major label debut Born to Mack, the 22-year-old coasted through the nearly 10-minute marathon powered by the same plainspoken and often vulgar realism. He leisurely pimp-steps into the pocket of the stripped-down funk loop; it’s an exercise in minimalism, aside from the litany of 38 women Too $hort summarily bangs with varying degrees of misadventure. But these brief, unfiltered snapshots, delivered with purposeful directness, had an elegance to them, despite the twin-sister threesomes and ill-advised bus sex—entire stories condensed into two simple, vivid lines, delivered with unmistakable confidence. It wasn’t that Too $hort wasn’t capable of going deep; he knew he didn’t need to. —Meaghan Garvey",Born to Mack,194,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Kano,“I'm Ready”,1980,"Not so much a band as a production outfit, the Italian trio Kano were formative to the emergence of Italo Disco, which added a mechanical pulse to dance music via the use of drum machines and synthesizers. Released in 1980, their song ""I’m Ready"" splices a human rhythm section and a pulsing sequenced bassline. The singers trade verses with heavily vocoded vocals, creating a sort of man vs. machine call and response. Even if you don’t recognize the song by name, you’ve probably heard it. A minor hit at the time, a sample of ""I’m Ready"" also forms the backbone of an even more ubiquitous tune: Tag Team’s 1993 hit, ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"".",Random Access Memories,193,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
William Onyeabor,“Good Name”,1983,"There’s a tense moment in the 2014 William Onyeabor documentary, Fantastic Man, when the Nigerian musician’s former distributor Obinna Obi reluctantly discloses ""an incident that made people get scared of him."" In the story, a boy visits the enigmatic superstar to chase royalties; Onyeabor responds by chasing him off his property with a pistol. When the kid returns with police they fail to find evidence, and he’s arrested for false accusation. ""That image, and air of a bully, was floating in the air,"" says Obi.",Fantastic Man,192,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Alice Coltrane,“Jagadishwar”,1982,"Beginning in the late '60s, Alice Coltrane released a brilliant run of spiritually rich records that blended Eastern instrumentation with experimental jazz. But by the end of the next decade, Coltrane—a harpist, pianist, composer and widow to jazz legend John Coltrane—had mostly gone quiet. Rather than performing or recording, she withdrew from the secular world, taking the name Turiyasangitananda and concentrating fully on spiritual life.",Turiya Sings,191,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Gregory Isaacs,“Night Nurse”,1982,"If there was an award for most creative metaphor for marijuana then Gregory Isaacs would take it for his soulful lament, ""Night Nurse"". It’s a rootsy interpolation of American R&B, guised as a vulnerable lover’s rock anthem ostensibly about a doting romantic partner. A closer read would suggest that ""Night Nurse"" alludes to the prolific Jamaican singer’s dependency to herb. ""I don’t want to see no doc/ I need attendance from my nurse 'round the clock/ 'Cause there is no prescription for me."" Isaacs’ relatively edgy repose stood in contrast to the peppy glam of countryman Bob Marley, garnering him the nickname the Cool Ruler. There’s a direct line between Isaacs’ addled troubadour and the Weeknd’s anesthetized analogies. Drug narratives in pop culture are often demonized for glamorizing usage, but Isaacs and his transcendent, lonely howl convey how complex, and necessary, stories of dependency and addiction can be in the right hands. —Anupa Mistry",Le Freak,190,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
EPMD,“You Gots to Chill”,1988,"EPMD weren't the first group to sample Zapp's ""More Bounce to the Ounce"", but they certainly helped usher it into the hip-hop mainstream. Ice Cube, Public Enemy, and Biggie (famously on ""Going Back to Cali"") are among the many artist who followed Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith's lead in lifting from the 1980 funk track. The futuristic, laidback sound (Zapp's robotic vocals sound like proto-Daft Punk) lent itself well to EPMD's early, unhurried swagger rap. ""You Gots to Chill"" stands out for the coolness of its insistence on its own greatness. Other rappers could claim their spot as the best, but lines like, ""To the average MC, I'm known as the Terminator/ Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator,"" delivered without heat, demonstrated the duo were more than capable—not just a couple of cocky rappers. Sermon and Smith didn't have time for any biting sucker MC's, calmly instructing them to step off: ""You gots to chill."" —Matthew Strauss",Le Freak,189,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Carly Simon,“Why”,1982,"In Nile Rodgers’ excellent 2011 memoir Le Freak, the Chic producer shares the golden rule that made him such a prolific songwriter: ""Every song had to have Deep Hidden Meaning… We felt that audiences would be more receptive to multilevel messages, just as long as they liked the groove."" The formula has legs, as the recent success of Daft Punk’s ""Get Lucky"", which Rodgers co-wrote with Pharrell, suggests. But in 1982, Rodgers and his partner Bernard Edwards used it to develop a post-disco pop song performed by Carly Simon, ""Why"". The cheery, memorable ""La-di-da-di-da"" on the pre-chorus stood in contrast to Simon’s sensual, melancholy thesis: ""Why does your love hurt so much?"" This was the two-pronged message Rodgers and Edwards delivered over delicate percussion and a sticky, guitar-led dub groove; DHM at work. ""Why"" did well on the charts, particularly overseas, but the song’s slinky gait meant that its legacy was secured in the club. Simon’s name is on the track but Rodgers and Edwards’ finesse has kept production nerds agog for decades: the extended mix was remastered and reissued as a 12'' in 2011. —Anupa Mistry",Le Freak,188,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Mtume,“Juicy Fruit”,1983,"Long before the Notorious B.I.G. sampled ""Juicy Fruit"" for his debut single, it was the lead track off the New York R&B group Mtume’s 1983 third album, Juicy Fruit. It’s since been sampled by everyone from Warren G to Montell Jordan, but when it was released, ""Juicy Fruit"" was a hit that made its way to roller skating rinks and nightclubs courtesy of a nocturnal groove tailored for summertime cookouts. The group’s bandleader James Mtume was the son of jazz saxophonist Jimmy Heath and had played and toured with Miles Davis for a few years in the '70s. ""I was experimenting with how to take less and make it sound more,"" he explained of the track. ""If you listen to something like ‘Juicy Fruit’, there’s only four or five instruments played. And that was a whole new thing. Also, there was no reverb on nothing. So it sounded like you could have played it in your basement."" Mtume has also said the label didn’t want to release the song because it was too slow; instead, they serviced it to nighttime radio, and it became a daytime hit. —Marcus J. Moore",Juicy Fruit,187,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Clash,“Rock the Casbah”,1982,"The Clash had pissed off the punks by going hard rock, stymied the rockers by embracing folk and reggae tradition, alienated traditionalists by turning into dub-funk experimentalists, and then, in 1982, shocked everyone by becoming pop stars. The band’s lone stateside Top 10 single, ""Rock the Casbah"" is the Clash’s entire conflicted, contradictory history streamlined into three minutes and 43 seconds, retrofitting the anti-authoritarian protest of their incendiary early singles for the discotheque, sculpting the genre-blurring sprawl of Sandinista! into military trim and upgrading their tommy guns to jet-fired laserbeams.",Sandinista!,186,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Class Action,“Weekend”,1983,"The brains behind Class Action didn’t constitute a band so much as a single idea, and ""Weekend"" was its perfect distillation. So perfect, in fact, that although it became its makers’ only hit together, it did so twice–once in 1978, and again five years later. Driving both conquests was Larry Levan, who'd made Phreek’s original a fixture of his disco temple Paradise Garage. By 1983, the meticulous arrangement had finally exhausted itself, so engineer Bob Blank hustled the old lineup back to the studio to record a post-disco revamp.",Top Five,185,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Wayne Smith,“Under Me Sleng Teng”,1985,"In much the same way that New Orleans R&B transmitted across the Caribbean to influence Jamaican music in the '50s and '60s, it’s fitting that ""Under Me Sleng Teng"", the seismic 1985 single from Wayne Smith, also had roots in old American rock’n’roll. In late 1984, Smith and a friend had gotten hold of a Casiotone MT40 keyboard and played around with the machine’s rock’n’roll preset, which sputtered out a fast and dinky version of Eddie Cochran’s 1959 rockabilly song, ""Somethin’ Else"". Over the delirious beat, Smith voiced his love for spliffs and his distrust of cocaine, taking lines from Barrington Levy's ""Under Mi Sensi"" and Yellowman's ""Under Me Fat Ting"".",Top Five,184,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Loose Joints,“Is It All Over My Face”,1980,"The transformation of Arthur Russell from cult favorite into widely praised figurehead is one of the great upsets of pop music history. Russell, a polyglot composer who made odd, personal music, was far likelier to end up a footnote, or sample fodder, than as the subject of documentaries and biographies, to see his archives mined for scraps of magic. But Russell's pensive solo works have always appealed to underground music fans, and a renewed interest in disco and post-disco—spearheaded by labels like DFA—has helped keep his dance productions in rotation. ""Is It All Over My Face"", produced with Steve D'Aquisto under his and Russell's Loose Joints alias, is the finest of those tracks, a collision of disco's pop and exploratory impulses.",Top Five,183,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Strafe,“Set It Off”,1984,"Nominally, Chris Rock’s Top Five is about a cocktail party topic: who are your five favorite rappers? And while the soundtrack featured old school tracks from Slick Rick and LL Cool J, one pivotal scene features the boom-tick of an 808 and the shout: ""Y’all want this party started, right? Y’all want this party started quickly, right?"" At the time of its release in 1984, Strafe’s ""Set It Off"" was at the nexus of New York City’s underground street musics: hip-hop, electro, and boogie, when the borders separating each genre were permeable. The work of Steve Standard (who as legend has it, borrowed the 808 from his friend Cozmo D of Newcleus, who had recently deployed the drum machine for ""Jam on It""), it came to the attention of retired disco DJ Walter Gibbons. Gibbons had remixed the likes of Gladys Knight and the Salsoul Orchestra (and would soon make iconic work with Arthur Russell) and started his own label so as to put out the song. It soon became the hottest track in New York, soundtracking moves by Paradise Garage dancers and breaking b-boys alike. That shout continues to be echoed by everyone from C+C Music Factory to 50 Cent, an old-school party-starter nearly three decades later. —Andy Beta",Top Five,182,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Womack & Womack,“Teardrops”,1988,"Four years on from Wham!’s ""Careless Whisper"", 1988’s ""Teardrops"" provided not only the decade’s other, superior take on the pitfalls of infidelity, but also its best argument for pop powered by restraint rather than excess. The underlying message may be the same—guilty feet ain’t got no rhythm—but ""Teardrops"" swaps desperation for quiet resignation, and impassioned chest-beating for melancholy understatement and resilience; the music may no longer feel the same, but Linda Womack tries to keep dancing. ""Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you,"" she announces with such understated dignity that her sadness feels more real, more intimate than almost any other vision of heartbreak in pop’s archives.",Love Wars,181,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Patrice Rushen,“Forget Me Nots”,1982,"In the crowded field that was early '80s R&B soul—with Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, Donna Summer, and Stephanie Mills, among others—Patrice Rushen emerged as a surprise. In the '70s, Rushen was primarily a jazz vocalist and musician who had already produced enough notable material to release a Best Of compilation. When her rhythmic, pop-leaning self-titled album arrived in 1978, Rushen quickly came under fire from the jazz community, which deemed her a sellout. Seeming to prove their point, Patrice earned Rushen her first charting single with ""Hang It Up"". 1979’s Pizazz was even less jazzy, and received similar criticism. After scoring three Top 5 hits on the U.S. dance charts from 1980 to 1981, she finally hit big with the funky ""Forget Me Nots"", a crossover smash about forlorned romance.",Patrice,180,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Joubert Singers,“Stand on the Word”,1985,"For those inclined to believe that music's power can be as uncanny as it is transcendent, here’s definitive proof. In 1982, Phyliss McKoy Joubert was minister of music at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights in Brooklyn. Her song ""Stand on the Word"", with the artist credited as the Celestial Choir, was part of a privately pressed compilation album recorded live at the church that spring. A rousing, piano-centered gospel number with a youthful lead vocal and funk underpinnings, the track caught the ear of Walter Gibbons, a disco pioneer who’d more recently become a born-again Christian—and whose studios were nearby.",How to Kill the DJ Part 2,179,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Nina Simone,“Fodder in Her Wings”,1982,"Fodder on My Wings was arguably the most honest record Nina released in the period when she seemed to have all but disappeared from music. In the near-decade that she escaped the States to live abroad, the only other studio album she recorded was 1978’s Baltimore, a record she says in her autobiography was made mostly to move her career along. Fodder on My Wings by contrast was a deeply personal, sometimes even playful, compendium of her time in the mid-'70s to mid-'80s spent flitting between Barbados, Liberia, and various European cities.",Fodder on My Wings,178,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Pretenders,“Brass in Pocket”,1980,"In 1973, Chrissie Hynde wanted to get the hell out of Akron, Ohio, the town where she was born and raised, so she cobbled together some money working odd jobs and set off for England. She managed to get a gig writing for NME, and eventually, she set out to put her own band together. It took a few tries, but she eventually found three guys from Hereford: bassist Pete Farndon, guitarist James Honeyman-Scott, and drummer Martin Chambers. The Pretenders could do breakneck songs in uncommon time signatures (Honeyman-Scott rips on ""Tattooed Love Boys""), but 1980’s ""Brass in Pocket"" was comparably delicate.",NME,177,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Schoolly D,“P.S.K. What Does It Mean?”,1985,"The Philly rapper Schoolly D’s ""P.S.K. What Does It Mean?"" is rightfully famous for being one of the first gangsta rap records, an early break from recorded hip-hop’s more polite sing-song genesis that incorporated the crude and raunchy language of the street. In that respect it’s been highly influential, inspiring MCs to spin long and detailed and often filthy tales of sex, drugs, and violence (see Ice-T’s ""6 ‘N the Mornin’"", among many others). But before you take in the specifics of Schoolly D’s narrative, ""P.S.K."" is experienced as a sonic assault, with a booming low end and clattering snares that sound like they’re echoing around the guts of an empty oil tanker. You feel it first and parse it later. There’s no harmonic information, nothing in the way of melody, just the relentless 808 and DJ Code Money’s insectile scratching, and it’s not remotely pop, standing miles from the disco and funk grooves that inspired rappers just a few years before (and unlike Run-D.M.C., Schoolly D did not care for rock’n’roll). When someone in 1985 said that rap wasn’t music, that it was just a bunch of noise with someone yelling nonsense over the top, they were imagining something very much like this, a record that dared you to hear sound in a new way. —Mark Richardson",Melody Maker,176,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
K-Rob / Rammellzee,“Beat Bop”,1983,"""Beat Bop""—part sound collage, part straight-up B-Boying-ready freestyle session—is most widely noted for being produced by Jean-Michel Basquiat, making it the artist’s most significant musical contribution outside of his no wave group Gray (though we shouldn’t forget his cameo in the ""Rapture"" video). The single was to be Basquiat’s great tribute to hip-hop culture, including all his own lyrics and was even to feature him as an additional MC. Instead, he was pushed into an ineffectual overseer position. Refusing to read the artist’s lyrics, Rammellzee—in the graffiti world, a rival of Basquiat’s, and sometimes-masked Renaissance man and mystic—and unknown 15-year-old street rapper K-Rob followed their own muse. Their labyrinthine verses are as full of contradictions and ""Did that just happen?"" curiosities as the erratic backing track. The more verbose Rammellzee's haunting, echoing delivery of phrases like ""Just freak that, yeah baba-y"" and ""Rock on to the break of dawn"" make him some Faustian answer to the Sugarhill Gang’s Master Gee. He plays pusherman and pimp, his voice shifting into nasal tones in abstract moments of jubilation; meanwhile, K-Rob, the golden heart, slinks through back alleys, relaying sharp images of poverty and systemic injustice.",Melody Maker,175,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Suicidal Tendencies,“Institutionalized”,1983,"""Institutionalized"" was the first thrash video aired on MTV, putting a couple of SoCal punks in flannels and baseball caps in the same airspace as Prince, Michael Jackson, and Journey. But the clip was more about staying on message rather than to expanding the channel's range—their pervasive ""I Want My MTV"" campaign was an overt means of mobilizing teens to yell at their parents until the parents yelled at cable providers. And no song outlines the mechanics of 11th-grade rage more clearly than Suicidal Tendencies’ ""Institutionalized"": 1) identify the problem; 2) recognize the problem is not identifiable; 3) get real frustrated; 4) have frustration compounded by the misunderstanding of parents, teachers, churches, schools, etc.; 5) work up the nervous energy to circle pit for about 15 seconds until you collapse and collect yourself to do it all over again. Like most displays of teen angst, it’s a little petty, somewhat aware of its own ridiculousness, pretty funny, and above all a cry for attention—whatever teen spirit may smell like, it’ll always taste like that Pepsi you just can’t have. —Ian Cohen",Melody Maker,174,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Wipers,“Youth of America”,1981,"It was the dawn of MTV and one of the best bands in America would abstain entirely from the music video boom. Greg Sage didn’t want mass appeal publicity for Wipers; he valued mystique. His initial plan was to release a ton of music but refuse to give interviews or share photos. He just wanted to hand over the records and let listeners react without expectation or context—he thought it would encourage thoughtful listening. It was a vision that failed to bring Wipers any commercial success, instead earning them cult hero status. Due to label pressure, Sage eased up on his self-imposed restrictions (except music videos, which he never made), but it’s easy to understand his logic.",Melody Maker,173,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Sugarcubes,“Birthday”,1987,"By the time Björk Guðmundsdóttir turned 21, she had already led several musical lives: covering the Beatles and Stevie Wonder in Icelandic on a novelty record released when she was just 12 and then going on to wail in restless teenage bands like the herky-jerky Tappi Tíkarrass (translation: Cork the Bitch's Ass) and the goth-tinged post-punk group Kukl. And then, for a laugh, the singer and her subversive friends decided to start a straight-up pop band. The Sugarcubes’ debut single came out on November 21, 1986—Björk’s 21st birthday—and featured a song called ""Ammæli"". It sold a few hundred copies. But over the course of the next year, they re-recorded the track in English, released it in the UK, and, largely thanks to a rave review in Melody Maker, quickly became the biggest Icelandic pop band in history.",Melody Maker,172,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Jùjú is a Nigerian popular music derived from Yoruba praise singing, and is a cousin to highlife. What King Sunny Ade did with it was help modernize it.

Cybotron,“Clear”,1983,"There's no tiptoeing around it: ""Clear"" is here primarily because it makes one really fucking cool sound. The skipping, phosphorescent synth melody that defines the track is one of those moments where early techno delivered on its promise of futurism, offering up a thrill that no rock or new wave or funk band could duplicate, a thrill still potent enough for hip-hop's most adventurous producer two decades later.

Many members of fellow Flying Nun bands passed through the Chills’ ranks over the years, but Phillipps was always the driving force, apparently in possession of an infinite array of addictive melodies and a huge well of melancholy from which to divine inspiration.",Radio,169,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
LL Cool J,“I Can't Live Without My Radio”,1985,"""I Can't Live Without My Radio"", the opener from Queens rapper LL Cool J’s 1985 debut Radio, is theoretically a love song to ghetto blaster culture, though it ended up being a lot more than that. Rick Rubin’s minimalist production; LL’s bold, bragging lyrics with their references to b-boy style, his prowess, his neighborhood, and responsible boombox maintenance (buying batteries, ""terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass"")—it all helped usher in the new school of hip-hop. This intense, immediate song pulled more from rock in length and sound (Radio's ""Rock the Bells"" sampled AC/DC) versus the meandering disco-inspired old-school typified by something like Sugar Hill Gang's ""Rapper’s Delight"". The track was included in the 1985 movie Krush Groove, a film that looked at the rise of new school hip-hop groups like LL Cool J, Run-D.M.C., and the Fat Boys. In turn, it helped influence the ""golden age"" of hip-hop, embodied by the likes of Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy. When it was released, though, it was just a song about a dude and the music that literally soundtracked his life. —Brandon Stosuy",Radio,168,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Yoko Ono,“Walking on Thin Ice”,1981,"Yoko Ono was always ahead of her time. ""Walking on Thin Ice"" made it official. She and John Lennon had left the song off of their 1980 album together, Double Fantasy. That album’s biggest A-sides, such as ""(Just Like) Starting Over"" and ""Woman"", successfully matched Lennon’s longstanding melodic directness with a mature perspective and contemporary production sheen. But it was a B-side, the Ono-led ""Kiss Kiss Kiss"", that, as Lennon told an interviewer, was ""getting a lot of rock club, new wave, disco exposure."" The emerging new-wave underground’s debt to Ono’s previous work was real—the B-52’s have acknowledged the influence the avant-garde artist’s shrill screams had on the iconic Athens, Ga. band’s late-'70s breakthrough ""Rock Lobster""—and the six-minute ""Walking on Thin Ice"" would be a ""special kind of disc for them.""",Double Fantasy,167,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
George Benson,“Give Me the Night”,1980,"For those who first hear Quincy Jones through Michael Jackson's Off the Wall and Thriller, it’s a thrill discovering Jones' prolific output from this era outside of Michael. The tight horns, swooping strings, and instrumental precision all remain in play; only a new character takes center stage. There's Jones' own solo album The Dude, and its can't-miss Chaz Jankel cover ""Ai No Corrida""; his work with Brothers Johnson, especially ""Stomp""; there's Chaka Khan and Rufus' ""Do You Love What You Feel"". But George Benson—a jazz guitarist who had few qualms about dipping into the pop world—was the lucky recipient of one of Jones' best records with the Rod Temperton-penned ""Give Me the Night"". Temperton, a songwriter and member of the band Heatwave, was responsible for Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"", ""Off the Wall"", and ""Thriller"", and collaborated frequently with Jones. On ""Give Me the Night,"" the ineffable elements of a Temperton record is in place: the assured swagger that offsets its unapologetic sweetness, the sugary euphoria packaged at the song's heart. Meanwhile, the rest of the record dances around it: background vocals scatting, an especially active bassline, those mellow guitar tones with his vocals echoing behind them, strings sweeping through the background. It's an idealistic song, one that envisions every evening as ideal as in memory, a celebration of celebration. —David Drake",Off the Wall,166,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Inner City,“Good Life”,1988,"Inner City was essentially an accident—a collision of Chicago and Detroit sprouted from an instrumental that techno forefather Kevin Saunderson didn't know how to finish. Vocalist Paris Grey helped Saunderson combine his club-ready sound with bona fide pop hooks, and it was an instant smash. ""Good Life"" was Inner City's peak and a reminder that even techno's sacredest cows—the guys who invented the genre itself—weren't averse to a bit of chart-baiting (something that today's dance music snobs could stand to remember). And chart it did: ""Good Life"" hit #4 on the UK pop charts at the beginning of 1989, a time when Britain couldn't get enough of American dance music. In the U.S., it reached a more modest #73, though it remains an enduring favorite in house DJ sets to this day. ""Good Life"" proved irresistible for heads and dilettantes alike, reinforcing a surge of interest in house music that has echoes of today's EDM explosion. And while there's a long lineage to be traced from Inner City—from classic MK dubs in the '90s to Duke Dumont's hits of the past few years—as often is the case with classic dance music, it's tough to beat the original. —Andrew Ryce",Zen Arcade,165,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Hüsker Dü,“Pink Turns to Blue”,1984,"Just as they rose to prominence in the '80s, Hüsker Dü found themselves on the precipice of a breakup due to creative conflicts between principal songwriters Bob Mould and Grant Hart. Mould was the razor-witted go-getter, and Grant was the dark hippie whose continued drug abuse threatened to rip the band apart. As unrest spread through the ranks, Hüsker Dü grew more vulnerable, casting shadows on sunny pop punk and confronting their demons directly. No song embodied the existential shroud as poignantly as Grant’s ""Pink Turns to Blue"", a hardcore rumination on death, transience, and uncertainty. In a subtle act of juxtaposition, the specter of death takes on dual guises: a mournful entity built from slashing guitar chords, and a poetic form conjured through soft, euphemistic language. As Grant desperately attempts to stifle his sorrow through images of fading hues and pacing angels, the churning void refuses to abate. The Zen Arcade standout reiterated Hüsker Dü’s greatest strength: capturing the feelings behind the fury without being torn asunder. —Zoe Camp",Zen Arcade,164,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Peter Gabriel,“In Your Eyes”,1986,"The first video for a single from Peter Gabriel’s 1986 album So was a creative masterstroke, combining then-revolutionary claymation (provided by the creators of ""Wallace & Gromit""), stop-motion, and pixilation technology to successfully rebrand an art-rock outsider as a cutting-edge multimedia pop artist. But the most enduring visual—and the one that made it Gabriel’s most enduring song—is just a single shot of a dude holding up a damn boombox.",So,163,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Orchestra Baobab,“Mouhamadou Bamba”,1984,"From the moment the opening clouds of guitar descend to the moment it ends with an odd, sudden fade, ""Mouhamadou Bamba"" pulses with dark energy.

U2,“Sunday Bloody Sunday”,1983,"Any skeptic who needs to be reminded that U2 were once a convincingly impassioned group of politically-inflamed upstarts should revisit ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"". Written as a public condemnation of the massacre by British soldiers of unarmed protesters in Derry, Ireland, it does what a great protest song should do, which is demand that it be played as loudly and recklessly as possible. It lurches like a train, opening the band’s third album, War, with a powerful declaration of collective drive—not just towards political justice, but towards a harshly angular, aggressive sound that could only have come from a foursome of very young musicians. It wasn’t the last time they would engage in political grandstanding, but it was the last time they sounded like they were willing to punch you in the face over it. In between the rolling snares and attack-ready guitars are seeds of the theatricality (see Bono’s howling exhortation to ""wipe your tears away"") that would later germinate into the palatial production and grand emotions of The Unforgettable Fire. ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" is a burning call to revolt with the added bite of youthful ambition, a potent message even now that its urgency has dulled. —Abigail Garnett",War,161,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Sheila E.,“The Glamorous Life”,1984,"One version of history: Prince’s genius is such that it trickles down to everyone he works with, elevating the ordinary and the non-notable of the world. Actual version of history: Prince had—still has—an uncanny knack for spotting (and frequently dating, but still) talented female artists, and giving them world-class platforms. While ""The Glamorous Life"" is undeniably a Prince song, from the worldly would-be celebutante who’s saved from independence by ""the seventh wave"" of making love to the horns that nudge-nudge all the lyrics, it’s a song that went to the right person. Prince’s lyric might’ve come off mocking delivered by someone else, but with Sheila it’s just there, a vessel for her to fill with a star’s worth of potential energy—much of it via percussion solo, deployed live like a sudden tornado. It’s the rare recording that sounds star-making on its own, without the confirmation bias of history, and it’s the rare producer who knows exactly what to do with a star when he hears one. —Katherine St. Asaph",sounds,160,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
George Clinton,“Atomic Dog”,1982,"George Clinton had been partying the night he recorded ""Atomic Dog""; then again, he'd been partying quite a bit in those days. George—Dr. Funkenstein, the Starchild himself, mad genius of Parliament-Funkadelic—arrived at the studio fresh from the club; Garry Shider and David Spradley, longtime P-Funk associates who laid down most of what would become ""Atomic Dog"", remember flanking him while he recorded his vocal so he wouldn't start listing to the side. He'd arrived with nothing prepared; it's unclear whether he'd even heard the track before. High as he was, George took one listen to that panting synth, and inspiration struck: A dog.

808 State,“Pacific State”,1989,"Giving the acid-drenched Madchester rave sound one of its first significant chart boosts by reaching the top 10 in the UK, Graham Massey and Martin Price’s ""Pacific State"" was the perfect cocktail of new age naturalism and club drugs. The sour synths and dry drum programming sounded distinctly North American, while its soothing chord progression and liberally-deployed loon calls evoked some kind of extraterrestrial paradise. One of their last tracks to feature contributions from Gerald Simpson, who would soon depart the group and release his own groundbreaking single as A Guy Called Gerald, ""Pacific State"" was the populist slow burner 808 State needed to cement their commercial appeal. Possibly in ironic rejection, the duo went on to release myriad versions of the track. But its hazy atmosphere, equally evocative of a warm beach with a cool breeze and a club with a packed-in crowd, proved an enduring influence on a new generation of techno producers (Aphex Twin, Autechre, Lone) and bleary-eyed ravers alike. —Abigail Garnett",Risky Business,158,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Orange Juice,“Rip It Up”,1982,"Come 1982, Edwyn Collins had a strong sense of his dues. Fed up with shambling along while charlatans like Haircut 100 commercialized Orange Juice's shtick, he fired his unambitious bandmates and signed up a sharper cohort. His bold move paid off: ""Rip It Up"", the title track of their second album, spent seven weeks climbing the UK singles chart to peak at #8, although it betrayed the fact that Collins was probably bluffing his pop chops rather than making a safe bet at longevity.",Risky Business,157,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Siouxsie and the Banshees,“Cities in Dust”,1985,"Pompeii is filled with ghosts. The point in visiting is to try and understand what it must have been like the day the city was engulfed by pumice and volcanic ash. There are petrified bodies—frozen in place at the moment of their death—on display in glass cases. The scene left an impact on Siouxsie Sioux. With ""Cities in Dust"", she imagines the final moments of these people, picturing them running, praying, and ultimately having their lungs and nostrils choked with lava. As an artist and songwriter, Siouxsie has empathy for the marginalized and doomed. In 1981, she wrote ""Arabian Knights"" about women being kept as ""baby machines."" Here, she’s singing to those people eternally stuck in display cases—their city left in dust and their bodies unearthed centuries later. It’s a shimmering bit of black magic pop, her voice howling through the bitter truth that all their stories, triumphs, and cherished memories are long gone even though tourists still stare into the hollow sockets where there used to be eyes. Right, people don’t just call her ""goth"" because of her makeup and color palate. —Evan Minsker",Risky Business,156,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
A Guy Called Gerald,“Voodoo Ray”,1988,"""Acid house"" is so named for the slippery, speaker-melting bass burbles produced by the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. But the name also evokes the mind-altering vibe of much of the '80s Chicago house that epitomized the style, evident in titles like Sleezy D.’s ""I’ve Lost Control"" and Adonis’s ""No Way Back"". Chicago acid house captured a specifically urban version of psychological dislocation, but UK groups like 808 State and its erstwhile member Gerald Simpson took the style and explored how it allowed you to get truly lost in the metaphysical sense, wandering free in the jungle of the mind.",Risky Business,155,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Tangerine Dream,“Love on a Real Train”,1985,"When they weren’t busy laying the groundwork for entire genres of ambient music and breaking ground with their innovative use of sequencers and digital instruments, Tangerine Dream kept up a fruitful sideline soundtracking films. They scored more than 60, covering everything from raunchy comedies to documentaries, horror films, thrillers, and science fiction. Their score for Paul Brickman’s 1983 satire of capitalism and suburban privilege, Risky Business, is comprised of tense, haunting soundscapes that are emotionally a world away from the raucous Bob Seger song that tracks the movie’s iconic solo dance scene.",Risky Business,154,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Joe Jackson,“Steppin' Out”,1982,"From all accounts, New York City was a total shithole in 1982: broken glass everywhere, the crack and AIDS epidemics, more than 2,000 murders in that year alone. Meanwhile, the upper tax brackets were busy fomenting the spiritual rot that would inspire Wall Street, American Psycho, and Bright Lights, Big City. And yet, on this 1982 hit, Joe Jackson vows that he and his date will be fearless like children, certain that New York City solely exists to cater to their night on the town (and that all of the bad stuff is happening to somebody else). It’s the same belief in New York’s invincibility espoused by proud capitalists (Frank Sinatra, Jay Z, Taylor Swift), shrewd miserablists (Ryan Adams, Interpol), and every incoming class at NYU. Jackson is none of the above, which makes ""Steppin’ Out"" sound particularly of its time, snowblinded by a Me Decade tunnel vision. Its perky, Kraftwerk-ian bassline and gilded keyboards offer a wide-eyed view of the world—either the result of naivety or a hit of the purest coke. Inevitably, the song served as the most memorable and fitting inclusion in 2002’s infamously amoral video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City: The perfect soundtrack for oblivious optimism in a hopelessly corrupt sewer. —Ian Cohen",Wall Street,153,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Frayed at the edges like the fanzines of the era, it was shot in 1988 on a borrowed Super 8 camera, its grainy abstractions all muted sea-blues, with a vaguely apocalyptic twist at the end.

Dead Kennedys,“Holiday in Cambodia”,1980,"The Internet did not invent entitled college students adopting social justice-related pet projects: it’s as considerable a cornerstone of higher academia as crushing debt. On their classic, caustic callout ""Holiday in Cambodia"", the Dead Kennedys behold this figure and deliver one of the most satisfyingly petty screeds in all of punk. Jello Biafra's gruesome, sardonic vacation pitch—""Slave for soldiers till you starve/ Then your head is skewered on a stake!""—and East Bay Ray’s cheery, ascendant riffs render the song the aural equivalent of a travel brochure from hell, as performed by a bunch of travel agents who could be considered clinically insane. The subject provides an easy, universal target: most of us have met someone who’s ""been to school for a year or two and [they] know they’ve seen it all""—lending the Kennedys’ aggro punk framework a universality relatable to punks and non-punks alike.

Shannon,“Let the Music Play”,1984,"In the liner notes to Madonna’s Immaculate Collection, writer Gene Sculatti singles out two tracks as the foundations of dance-pop: ""Holiday"" (naturally, given the source) and ""Let the Music Play"". Foundational the latter certainly was; it more or less invented the Latin-derived, still-venue-packing freestyle scene, and for a while the genre was synonymous with ""the Shannon sound."" Producer Chris Barbosa’s working title was ""Fire and Ice"", which is descriptive if nothing else: gloomy synth pads, acid squiggles, percussion flickering in and out, everything setting off everything else.

Al B. Sure!,“Nite and Day”,1988,"The term ""New Jack Swing"" was coined by Barry Michael Cooper in the Village Voice as an offhand joke, meant to describe Teddy Riley’s bleeding together of hip-hop and R&B. The style may have burned briefly—it peaked in late '80s and faded away into the '90s—but it was the beginning of a momentous relationship. Hip-hop, still the music of troubled Black youth, represented a risk for producers who wished to combine it with the increasingly aging R&B. The merger didn’t exactly ease tensions on all sides (""You can new jack swing on my nuts,"" Ice Cube rapped on 1991’s Death Certificate), but by injecting the swagger of hip-hop, new jack swing established the bridge between two styles that previously kept their distance.",Village Voice,148,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Michael McDonald,“I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)”,1982,"Michael McDonald’s ""I Keep Forgettin’ (Every Time You’re Near)"" is a quiet storm classic whose liquid groove has buttressed other great songs through the years (ask Warren G and Madlib), but its sneaky triumph, beneath the durability of the hook and message, is compositional. It’s a breakup song actually shaped like a breakup. Starting at denial, ""I Keep Forgettin’"" cycles woozily through yearning, regret, and all the other irrational emotions that bubble to the surface in the wake of a grueling split. McDonald’s numb, phantom longing is matched to music (featuring ""Rosanna""-era Toto players) that comes in stormy but slowly clears up, only to drop back into the murky dark again exactly as he comes to the realization that he’s clinging to the apparition of a closeness long since departed. It’s a sad song that refuses to accept that it’s a sad one. Guiding us through it all is The Voice. People say it’s garbled, but what they’re really hearing is wounded tenderness punching through the confines of both register and diction to commute a feeling you don’t need to know the words to get caught up by. —Craig Jenkins",Scary Monsters,147,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
David Bowie,“Modern Love”,1983,"Fed up with what he called the ""rock’n’roll circus,"" David Bowie seemed to abandon music altogether in the early '80s; fans accustomed to an artist who released 11 albums in 11 years didn’t hear much of anything in the three years following 1980's Scary Monsters. When he did come back, it was with a new label, a new backing band, and his most cleaned up, least self-consciously artistic persona to date. Though Let’s Dance was perceived by many to be slick, pre-packaged pop, Bowie’s nihilistic musings on ""Modern Love"" act as a subversive force against the track’s smiling rockabilly-meets-Motown bounce. Its feeling is captured beautifully in a cult-iconic scene from Noah Baumbach’s 2012 film Frances Ha: Even as Greta Gerwig’s title character sees her life slowly going to shit, her dash through New York to “Modern Love” is an expression of pure joy—a reminder of the musical spirit that marked Bowie’s return in 1983. —Jonah Bromwich",Scary Monsters,146,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Beat Happening,“Indian Summer”,1988,"Most of the appeal of Beat Happening lay in its unvarnished simplicity. Relative to the mid-1980s music industry—the gloss of pop, the pomp of rock, the palpable angst of punk—the Olympia, Wash., trio trafficked in DIY directness. By example, Calvin Johnson, Bret Lunsford, and Heather Lewis insisted that the actualization of self-expression needn’t be Rubik’s Cube complex: all one needed was a voice, an idea, a tape recorder, some friends, and a passion for music for its own sake. There was no need to possess Category Whitney Houston pipes or be a virtuoso shredder or have CAA representing you; you didn’t need anyone’s expressed permission. This notion never stopped reverberating outward, and went on to influence artists of varying stripes and disciplines—many of whom never even heard ""Indian Summer"". Revered in underground circles and covered by everyone from the Vaselines to Luna to R.E.M., ""Indian Summer"" both embodies this ethos and upends it. While the frisson between Johnson’s unstudied baritone and the chiming, seesaw guitar offers contrasting delights in its own right, the song’s rich lyrical potpourri—evoking autumn beauty or the fall of industry, childhood reverie or the loss of innocence, the collapse of camaraderie or harvest season—puts the lie to dismissal of this aesthetic as slight or insubstantial.

Instead, their subdued debut single radically normalized the idea that a young gay man might run away from the ostracization of his hometown—""the love that you need will never be found at home""—allowing for private revelations in front of the TV as your parents read Jeffrey Archer novels on the sofa. At a time when striking miners found allies in the queer community and Britain had its first openly gay politician, the domestic transgression of ""Smalltown Boy"" is an enduring emblem of the times. Its rain-beaten take on disco's enlightened metropolitan whirl retains its sense of subtle subversion—that Jimmy Somerville's rapture sounds a little parochial now is testament to the tides it helped turn. —Laura Snapes",joie de vivre,141,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Spacemen 3,“Walkin’ With Jesus”,1988,"When Spacemen 3 emerged from Rugby, England, in the early '80s, their Velvet Underground-influenced post-punk wasn’t completely unique; Jesus and Mary Chain, for one, were mining a similar territory. But few other bands were just as interested in the soar of gospel music as the drone of the Velvets, and certainly none grafted the dreamy intoxication of drugs onto the higher-ground spirituality of religion as powerfully as Spacemen 3. One of their first songs, ""Walkin’ With Jesus"", struck this God/dope fusion with remarkable simplicity. Over an unwavering two-chord organ swing that sounds like it was played while laying down, Jason Pierce hears Jesus promise an eternity in Hell as punishment for indulging in Heaven on Earth. It doesn’t exactly shake him from his drift; once he realizes he should probably take some action, he’s too blissed-out to do anything besides ask Jesus for an extension.",joie de vivre,140,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Rob Base / DJ E-Z Rock,“It Takes Two”,1988,"Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock’s ""It Takes Two"" went supernova in 1988: The song broke big in dance clubs, in rock clubs. It was popular with older, gay house audiences and with mainstream pop audiences. It sold a million copies, and entered the tiny rarefied circle of songs that regularly received name-checks on big MTV countdowns of Greatest Rock Songs. Predictably, it provoked suspicious glances in the hip-hop community, which only a few years away from the twin takeovers of Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer. But ""It Takes Two"" endures where dated pop-house tracks from the era didn’t. It is rap crossover in its Platonic form —hardcore, quicksilver rhymes, up-to-the minute with the clean technicality and tricky rhythms, laid over a beat so universal that it felt like kid’s music. At the time, it felt like the last gasp of party rap, a song about nothing more than dancing, getting loose, and being fresh on the microphone as hip-hop grew increasingly militarized. Where hip-hop was being pulled into the crack wars, New Jack Swing was smooth, clean-cut, and full of smiles; it channeled an older generation Harlem, that of Frankie Crocker and WBLS.

Lines about heroes, dreams, and ""the spirit fight[ing] to find its way"" make it sound like a battle hymn, especially during its all-for-one-and-one-for-all chorus.

Motörhead,“Ace of Spades”,1980,"In the face of rock music’s gorgeous gods with their Jesus hair and bare chests, Lemmy’s greasy allure was clear. With his iconic handlebar mustache and facial warts, he was the underdog—the guy that got kicked out of Hawkwind because most of the band’s members flat-out didn’t like him. His excommunication was a blessing; he could start Motörhead in his own gnarly image. They got some traction on the charts with their 1978 cover of ""Louie Louie"", but ""Ace of Spades"" was an aesthetic-cementing moment. In 1979, Lemmy got an ace of spades tattooed on his forearm surrounded by the words ""born to lose, live to win"". That symbol became a mantra of sorts; Motörhead were bad luck incarnate—a trio of cackling hooligans up to no good. Lemmy insists there’s no allegory in the lyrics of ""Ace of Spades"", but even if it’s just a song about gambling, the emphasis is fearlessness. ""You win some, lose some, it’s all the same to me,"" he sings in a throaty gargle over his dive-bombing bassline. The song packed a punch and made a huge impression on headbangers listening across the world (notably: Metallica, Slash, Dave Grohl, Triple H). Motörhead had punk’s ferocity and speed with metal’s guitar heroics and heft. On the album cover, they dressed up as gunslingers—a gig that requires staring down the threat of obliteration.

Pixies,“Gigantic”,1988,"The Pixies’ debut single cemented the loud-quiet-loud template that would characterize so many of their best songs. National treasure Kim Deal has gone on record saying that the song was inspired by a 1986 film adaptation of Beth Henley’s ""Crimes of the Heart"", in which a married Sissy Spacek falls in love with a black teenage boy. The taboo origin story is certainly interesting—""what a big black mess, what a hunk of love""—but it’s the song’s outrageous catchiness and joie de vivre that makes it unforgettable. ""Gigantic"" is a perfect marriage of iconic bassline, magnificently rendered vocals (Deal’s signature coo was made for the lines, ""And this I know, his teeth as white as snow, what a gas it was to see him""), and a rip-roaring chorus that sounds as appropriately enormous as the song title implies. A perfect amalgam of loud guitars and euphoric lust, ""Gigantic"" is everything you want it to be—a big, big love. —T. Cole Rachel",joie de vivre,136,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Queen & David Bowie,“Under Pressure”,1981,"""This is our last dance!,"" David Bowie declares during the chandelier-rattling climax of ""Under Pressure"", and the man is nothing if not a master of faking his own imminent demise. If anything, ""Under Pressure"" was something of a victory lap for a pair of '70s glam-rock veterans coming off of successful incursions into the post-disco, new-waved landscape of '80s pop—Bowie with Scary Monsters, Queen with The Game. But while its foundational, Vanilla Ice-spawning bassline heeds the most valuable lesson of the latter album—i.e., that John Deacon is Queen’s secret weapon—""Under Pressure"" feels all the more like a special, lightning-in-a-bottle moment for sounding very little like anything Bowie was producing at the time, nor like much else on Hot Space, the funk-influenced Queen album where this one-off single eventually took up residence.",Scary Monsters,135,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Fleetwood Mac,“Everywhere”,1987,"While Stevie Nicks might be the most widely known member of Fleetwood Mac, Christine McVie, to many fans, is the hero. McVie penned many of the band’s biggest hits, and 1987’s ""Everywhere"" stands out, not only as one of the band’s most commercial singles, but also as one of McVie’s strongest. It’s is carefully crafted, spare, and meticulously produced. McVie approaches the vocals with a light touch, and the contrast between that lightness and the songs sweeping sentiment—not only does she want to be with her lover, but she wants ""to be with [them] everywhere""—is reflective of the time in which it was written. In the '80s, bigness, whether it be of sound, or wealth, or hair, was a given, and didn’t have to mean anything serious; McVie tempered this outsized lyrical message with an arrangement that was refreshingly minimal for the time. ""Everywhere"" wasn’t the biggest hit on Tango in the Night—""Little Lies"" and ""Big Love"" charted higher, reaching #4 and #5 respectively—but it’s one of the quintessential songs of the '80s, and an elegant example of Fleetwood Mac’s nimbleness and adaptability. —Maud Deitch",Tango in the Night,134,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Godley & Creme,“Cry”,1985,"If this list was about '80s music videos, the work of Kevin Godley and Lol Crème would surely dominate—the former pair of 10cc musicians worked on innovative promos for the Police, Duran Duran, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Herbie Hancock’s ""Rockit"" among others. ""Cry"" had a similarly impressive (for the time) visual counterpart, highlighting how important music videos were to breaking songs in this era. Indeed, Godley & Creme’s words on the art of '80s video making in Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum’s I Want My MTV form some of the most entertaining and outlandish anecdotes of the era.",I Want My MTV,133,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Yellowman,"“Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt”",1984,"The popularity of the Jamaican vocalist Yellowman helped signal the shift from roots reggae to dancehall, a shift almost as radical as the one that turned funk breaks into early rap. Roots was deep, spiritual music that compressed social ideals into grave, sometimes mystical ballads; dancehall was better known for sentiments that were ""Icky All Over"". Musical values were different, too: Where roots was lush and soulful, dancehall used stiff Casio presets and turned the vocalist into an MC—someone who doesn’t sing over the track so much as inhabit it with one-liners, nursery rhymes, and other bits of half-music.",dundus,132,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Phil Collins,“In the Air Tonight”,1981,"Few cultural artifacts scream, ""Ah yes, the 1980s,"" louder than Phil Collins’ ""In the Air Tonight"". It might as well be a demo of the trends that were to dominate popular music in the decade following its 1981 release, while managing to sound like no other extant piece of recorded music. People remember Collins’ breakout single for many different reasons: for the urban legend surrounding its writing (a brutal kiss-off to an ex-lover or an elegy to a dead friend?), for Collins’ washed-out face staring out from the hit video’s digital void, for its tortured, choked vocals, or for that incomparable drum fill. The ballad was also, of course, the bold announcement of Phil Collins the solo artist, who later would go on to have the most prolific run of UK Top 40 singles of any artist of that decade.",Murmur,131,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
This Mortal Coil,“Song to the Siren”,1983,"Tim Buckley’s ""Song to the Siren"" is impossible to ruin—the folk ballad’s self-evidently beautiful melody and resonant extended metaphor transcend pretty much any arrangement (even if no one has figured out what ""as puzzled as the oyster"" is supposed to mean). But while there are many wonderful covers out there, let’s be real: This song was created so that it could be sung by Elizabeth Fraser over Robin Guthrie’s barely-there guitar strum.

Cyndi Lauper,“Girls Just Want to Have Fun”,1983,"A moment's reverence, please, for the once-proven dream of unproblematic female pop solidarity. When Lauper left her Queens home at age 17, she took with her a paper bag containing a toothbrush, clean underwear, an apple, and a copy of Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. Thirteen years later, one of Ono's gnomic instructions might have served as the ethos behind Lauper's solo career: ""A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality."" In 2015, Lauper's debut single feels like a fantasy: a globally famous, totally inclusive feminist anthem that preaches pleasure, recognition, and autonomy, and eschews societal expectations. Sure, it achieves that through defiantly simple lyrics that were originally written by a man—Robert Hazard demoed it, Springsteen-style, in '79—but Cyndi Lauper's neat tweaks skewed it from a song that trivialized female desire to one that runs and runs on it.",Grapefruit,128,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Janet Jackson,“Control”,1986,"At this point, it seems as if Janet Jackson and her longtime studio accomplices Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis were always the model for artist-producer synergy, twin forces forever meant to exist in tandem. Like most matters of pop, songwriting, and the industry, though, this theory appears to unravel with a bit with research. In fact, much of Janet’s breakthrough 1986 album Control was originally written for R&B singer Sharon Bryant, but she decided they were too ""rambunctious."" Yet Jackson, who was trying to put her bubblegum teenage years behind her, took charge of Control as no one else could. She wrote the toplines and arranged the complex vocals, which mix spoken-word, nonchalant rap-singing, and little iconic GIF-bursts of ad-libs. She helped with keyboards and synths. She reached into the Jam & Lewis machine and bent every part of it to her will, rearranging all the gears into a coat of armor. ""Control"" is the sound of Janet Jackson underlining her career moves, her decisions, her identity. —Katherine St. Asaph",Control,127,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Replacements,“Bastards of Young”,1985,"In his entertaining 2007 oral history of the Replacements, All Over But the Shouting, writer Jim Walsh recounts one of the band’s early gigs at the Sons of Norway building in Minneapolis. Walsh suggests that it’s a short leap from there to imagine a young Paul Westerberg transforming the name of the fraternal organization Sons of Norway into the dispossessed ""We are the sons of no one"" chorus on the group’s raucous anti-generational anthem, ""Bastards of Young"". For people listening to the Replacements’ Tim on vinyl (or cassette) in 1985, ""Bastards of Young"" was the opening song of side two, arguably the single strongest album side in the group’s entire discography.",All Over But the Shouting,126,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
De La Soul,“Eye Know”,1989,"One of the most innovative rap albums of all time, De La Soul's debut 3 Feet High and Rising changed the way hip-hop approached sampling, but the album wouldn't have resonated so widely if it were merely a playground for producer Prince Paul. De La Soul had the songs to back up their inventive production, and none of them better captured the trio’s good-natured disposition than ""Eye Know"". It's a straightforward love song, with rappers Posdnous and Trugoy the Dove each attempting to woo the objects of their affection with old-fashioned chivalry. ""Sex is a mere molecule in this world of love that I have for you,"" Trugoy promises with geeky sincerity. Though the rappers sound too much like blushing teenagers to expect a return on their overtures, the song made it clear that women were welcome in their D.A.I.S.Y. revolution—a refreshing assurance at a time when sexism was beginning to sour rap music.",3 Feet High and Rising,125,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Grandmaster & Melle Mel,“White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)”,1984,"Hip-hop had been party music for most of its first few recorded years, but there's such a thing as too much partying, and ""White Lines"" is a snapshot of the moment when drug-fueled fun is just about to crash. (There was a lot of powder floating around at the time—1983 was also the year of Laid Back's ""White Horse"", for instance.) Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five had made the first major political hip-hop single the year before with ""The Message"", but even by then they were already disintegrating. So ""White Lines"", more or less a solo record by the group's MC Melle Mel, was credited on release to ""Grandmaster & Melle Mel"". Flash, their original DJ, was the name everyone knew, but he was long since out of the group at that point; he first heard ""White Lines"" while on his way to buy coke.",fight it,123,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Slick Rick / Doug E. Fresh,“La Di Da Di”,1985,"The line on Slick Rick is that he’s one of hip-hop’s great storytellers, a guy who realized the narrative possibilities of the medium and constructed songs with plots where one action followed from the next. And ""La Di Da Di"", his breakthrough song with human beatbox Doug E. Fresh, is without question a fine example of his writerly talent. He tells of a day in the life in which he wakes up, falls out of bed, puts his Kangol upon his head, and ultimately watches a mother beat the living crap out of her daughter because they’re both hopelessly in love with him. But while the blow-by-blow of the story and Rick’s running commentary have their charms, the real genius of ""La Di Da Di"" is in the delivery. With this song, he invented a kind of tuneful rapping in which a spoken phrase could become a melodic hook at any moment. The simple melodies found in ""La Di Da Di"" have become part of rap’s DNA, and the song has been repeatedly stripped for parts by the likes of Biggie, N.W.A, and Snoop. To listen to ""La Di Da Di"" now is to trace three decades of history in under five minutes, all of it leading back to Rick’s place. —Mark Richardson",a capella,122,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Dalí was supposedly so taken with Rick's appearance—he was one beautiful motherfucker back then—he insisted he draw him. We'll never see the thing; Rick pocketed Dalí's sketch, got stoned, went for a swim, and ruined it. To say the least, Rick James led a colorful life: a draft dodger, a failed pimp (too lenient, by his own admission), ex-bandmate of Neil Young and ex-lover of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, Rick picked up the cup of life and proceeded to spill it all over the carpet.",a capella,121,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Wheeler, a veteran of London’s lover’s rock scene since the late 1970s, had more than a decade of experience projecting soul not through volume, but via shading and tone, and she doesn’t sing those hooks as much as chant them like mantras. Jazzie B and Nellee Hooper’s production work burnishes her voice with a slight digital sheen, rendering Wheeler's passion slightly paranormal.",a capella,120,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Minutemen,“History Lesson – Part II”,1984,"Though San Pedro punk band Minutemen were a trio, with each member contributing an essential part of their uncompromising and efficient sound, much of their energy derived from the long-term friendship between guitarist D. Boon and bassist Mike Watt. ""History Lesson – Part II"" is the story of that friendship. It chronicles the band’s pure love for music (and punk in particular) and their philosophy of ""jamming econo""—or keeping their operation as a band, from songwriting to touring, simple and low-cost—in just over two minutes. This song, and the double album it appears on, Double Nickels on the Dime, influenced countless artists, paved the way for the '90s alternative rock countercultural shift, and helped establish punk firmly as an enduring philosophy rather than a set of aesthetic boundaries. The Boon quote that became a nearly-ubiquitous '90s sticker is, ""Punk is whatever we made it to be,"" and there’s no other Minutemen song that so clearly exemplifies this attitude. Though Boon was tragically killed in a van accident in late 1985, his influence is just as present today as it was in '84, through his recorded work, through his bandmates’ continuation of his legacy, and through anyone who ever heard the line ""Punk rock changed our lives,"" and felt it in their bones. —Jes Skolnik",Double Nickels on the Dime,119,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

The box set had it all. Discs one and two, ""The Tracks That Built the House"", focused on the disco and Italo sounds that Frankie Knuckles had been playing at the Power Plant and the Warehouse. Disc three focused on the D.J. International label's roster—artists like J.M.

Sade,“Is It a Crime”,1985,"British jazz&B group Sade’s sophomore far-from-slump Promise catapulted them to indisputable superstardom in 1985. ""Smooth Operator"" had made their debut Diamond Life an international hit the previous year, but Promise was an instant #1, popular enough that, in addition to the three singles, DJs had begun to spin album tracks by '86, the first being the expansive opener ""Is It a Crime"". The six-and-a-half-minute, winding epic is a masterclass in dramatic dynamic shifts. The chorus strips everything away rather than building it up; it’s a near-whisper, the fallout after a wild-eyed, horn-bolstered escalation (""My love is wider than Victoria Lake/ Taller than the Empire state…""). It’s a song about self-doubt and forced emotional restraint, and musically, too, it's all seething indecision. Sade belts as intensely as she ever has, pushing past her normal sheen of breathiness.",Promise,117,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
INXS,“Never Tear Us Apart”,1988,"The fourth single from INXS' world-conquering Kick, ""Never Tear Us Apart"" has often shouldered the burden of tragedy; it was never intended to play at frontman Michael Hutchence’s funeral in 1997 or to lend an all-too-apt title to the band’s postmortem documentary last year. It’s hard to hear the song outside of that undesired context, but at its heart ""Never Tear Us Apart"" is a surprisingly straightforward declaration of love, caught somewhere between American soul and a European waltz, between Motown and Prague. It contains one of the most satisfying moments in '80s pop, a moment so curious, so inventive, so unexpected that it becomes endlessly replayable: As Hutchence concludes the second chorus, his words lingering in the cold air, an expectant drumroll gives way to—a saxophone solo. In another context, that instrument might sound lascivious, adding a sexual layer to a sensual song, but here it sounds stately, even monumental, as INXS shed the weight of the world just so it can savor this one present moment. —Stephen M.

Talk Talk,“Life's What You Make It”,1985,"""The label didn't hear a single."" When that phrase is thrown at a gestating album, it usually turns out to be a thorn in the band's side—even more often when it's a demonstrably pop-friendly group with auteurist aspirations. Yet Talk Talk, who were riding off expectations set by earlier trans-Atlantic new wave-simpatico hits like ""It's My Life"" and ""Such a Shame"", found an ingenious end run around what could've been a deadening compromise. All they had to do was center their label-pleasing song around a simple, hooky sentiment—""Life's what you make it""—around which they could build interrogating phrases (""Yesterday's favorite/ Don't you hate it""; ""Don't try to shade it/ Beauty is naked"") that got more enigmatic the deeper you went. From there, all that was left was to set the words over a slow-motion piano-driven Lee Harris march that was closer to a gothic Sade than anything It's My Life even hinted at, lace it with a recurring guitar wail that sounded like arena rock melting from catharsis, and let Mark Hollis belt out an impassioned lead that built from crescendo to crescendo—there's your hit. ""Life's What You Make It"" was their last brush with mainstream success before the more ambitious, experimental records Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock, albums that jettisoned Talk Talk from the ranks of arty pop and into the realm of cult genius, and this particular transition between the two phases is priceless. —Nate Patrin",It's My Life,115,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Isley Brothers,“Between the Sheets”,1983,"After the commercial failure of 1982's The Real Deal—an awkward attempt to update their traditional-leaning blend of R&B and funk with the synthesizer-heavy sounds of artists like Rick James and Prince—the Isley Brothers returned less than a year later with ""Between the Sheets"", one of their plushest tracks ever. It's 1,200-thread-count music that doesn't abandon the group's knack for marrying melody to groove. Incorporating the emerging sounds of electro-funk on the Isleys’ own terms this time, ""Between the Sheets"" also benefits from Ronald's unrushed, virtuosic vocals, which set a new benchmark for sensuality. ""Enough of this singing; let's make love,"" Ronald urges as the track darkens thrillingly, pulsing with carnal tension.

Nirvana,“About a Girl”,1989,"Then as now, the Nirvana of 1989 debut Bleach has much to recommend and set it apart from contemporaries like the Melvins and Mudhoney: Kurt Cobain’s wounded caterwaul, garrote-wire riffs, a heavy, dynamic melodicism, and a bleak sardonic sense that the album’s production positions front and center. But it was ""About a Girl""—sharp, perceptive, well-constructed, and almost Beatles-esque—that demonstrated a potential beyond grunge’s ghetto. When Tracy Marander, Cobain’s girlfriend at the time, complained that he’d never written a song about her, this was his sweet'n'sour riposte, a winning, winsome plaint of woe from an unemployed layabout whose significant other supported him. ""Girl"", like so many of Nirvana’s best songs, places beautiful songwriting into mortal conflict with bitingly cynical lyricism: Love’s a mystery and romantic cohabitation is bullshit, but at least getting laid demands minimal travel and effort. —Raymond Cummings",Bleach,113,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Guitarist Mick Jones was especially inspired, buying into hip-hop so fully, the story goes, that his bandmates started calling him ""Whack Attack""—a detail that sounds like it must have been made up, until you remember his subsequent run with Big Audio Dynamite.

The Smiths,“This Charming Man”,1983,"""This Charming Man"" is the story of the serendipitous meeting between a young man stranded by the side of the road and a dashing bon vivant in a pristine automobile who comes to his rescue. It’s a scene so quintessentially Steven Patrick Morrissey it would border on parody if it weren’t for the fact that ""This Charming Man"" was the second-ever single released by the Smiths. There are references to, subtly and overtly, English modernist author Henry Green’s Loving, the 1972 Laurence Oliver film Sleuth, and avant-garde filmmaker Jean Cocteau (the Moz-designed single sleeve features a still from 1950’s Orphée). The song itself was initially written out of jealousy for Rough Trade labelmates Aztec Camera by guitarist Johnny Marr, and was the band’s first bid for a ""hit""—""something upbeat and in a major key,"" according to Marr. It was a modest success upon release in 1983, but hit number eight on the UK charts in 1992 when it was reissued, becoming the Smiths' highest chart placement ever.

There you had DJs—primarily gay Latinos and blacks—spinning to largely Latino and black audiences from Chicago's South and West sides, and moreover spinning music produced largely by gay Latinos and blacks. If the weirdness of the music—early Trax Records alongside various and sundry local labels—contrasted a little with the party vibes, that made sense too: life was not easy for these musicians and dancers, so even their parties weren't going to always sound like other people’s parties.",Eye in the Sky,109,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Madonna,“Borderline”,1984,"Released in 1983, ""Borderline"" is one of the first laid bricks in the cathedral of Madonna’s mythology, four minutes of emotional helium that became her first Top 10 hit on the heels of an iconic music video. In the clip, Madonna closes the gap between the club kid she was and the glamorous star she’d become as she plays her two beaux—a Latino tough boy and a snobby British photographer—off each other. Ironically, while lyrics refer to the gnawing desolation one might feel while navigating a relationship in which they don’t have any power, Madonna has total control in the video. She makes the tough boy miss his shot at the pool table by simply standing in the doorway; she spray paints the photographer’s car, causing him to flip out. She takes the energy from the song—a bubblegum instrumental given weight by her legible vocal performance—and uses it to dispel all the lingering demons from that bad relationship. There’s so much charisma, it’s easy to see why this was the song that catapulted her toward being the biggest pop star in the world. —Jeremy Gordon",Disintegration,107,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Cure,“Pictures of You”,1989,"The liner notes of the Cure’s Disintegration made one simple demand: turn it up, loud. This request actually asked lot of the listener.

""I’ve been looking so long at these pictures of you/ That I almost believe that they’re real,"" Robert Smith wails as guitars layer infinity pools over him for seven minutes—by the end, you might actually believe that ""we kissed as the sky fell in,"" ""[screaming] at the make believe"" and ""crying for the death of your heart"" are real things couples go through. Tally the time Robert Smith has pined for a lost love over the past 40 years and you’ll have hours, if not entire days worth of music.

AC/DC,“Back in Black”,1980,"Along with Kiss and Ozzy, AC/DC were scourges on the forces of respectability: a convenient villain for the church, the school, the town hall, and the PMRC. Rumors abounded about the band. The name was an acronym for Anti-Christ/Devil Child (not true). Their first singer drank himself to death (true). Their music reportedly inspired serial killer Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker (true). The band only grew more and more popular during the 1980s, even after the death of founding member Bon Scott, perhaps because they somehow became blunter, harder, simpler, and more primal—and they were already all three when they started. ""Back in Black"" remains monolithically perfect, a brick through a window that doesn't sound any less brutal today. New hire Brian Johnson has a formidable set of pipes and sings like he’s peeling off a layer of skin, and Malcolm Young’s rhythm guitar emerges as the rudest element, selling the song’s lewdness as something glorious and unique.

Whitney Houston,“How Will I Know”,1985,"It feels like sacrilege to imagine an alternate timeline where ""How Will I Know"", the third single from 22-year old Whitney Houston’s 1985 debut, ended up a Janet Jackson song, as originally intended. For Jackson, control was freaky and liberating, something you wielded by choice. But for Houston, control was a lifestyle, a guiding principle—forever maintaining the perfect temporary balance between unthinkable technical precision and unchecked emotional release. Later, with Bobby Brown, it was something darker. Control, and its absence, was the core of ""How Will I Know"" beyond mere infatuation, and why it’s gotten so much more affecting with time: the terrifying rush of losing yourself.

He helped the Wreckin’ Cru ink a record deal with CBS Records, but he was also a tremendous pain in the ass: He had a problem with speeding tickets, and a related problem with showing up for court dates. Perhaps inevitably, he also had a problem with getting thrown in jail. Repeatedly. On one occasion, Lonzo Williams, his mentor and manager, was unmoved. ""Sit in jail,"" Williams told him. So Dre picked up the phone and called a gap-toothed, squeaky-voiced drug dealer named Eric Wright, a fellow pain in the ass who had been bugging Young ceaselessly about recording together for a nonexistent venture he called Ruthless Records. These are the deeply inauspicious circumstances that yielded ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"", a deeply auspicious song.",Sit in jail,102,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Church,“Under the Milky Way”,1988,"The Church had already had a taste of the major-label system when they signed to Arista in the late '80s, but it wasn't until they recorded their 1988 album Starfish in Los Angeles that they fully witnessed the excesses of the music industry. Those sessions paired them, uncomfortably, with veteran producers Waddy Watchel and Greg Ladanyi, old-guard industry hands who spent their career recording with acts like Fleetwood Mac, Warren Zevon, and Keith Richards, and who weren't shy about tapping Arista's generous expense account. ""We all had to have our special cars and apartments,"" guitarist Marty Wilson-Piper marveled 20 years later.

Sister Nancy,“Bam Bam”,1982,"""Bam Bam"" is one of those songs you know without knowing, a piece of cultural confetti that has fluttered in the margins of pop culture for 30 years. According to the always-fascinating Whosampled.com, it has been sampled 63 times, mostly in hip-hop, as early as 1982 and as recently as 2014, in Major Lazer’s ""Sound Bang"". It was in the 1998 movie Belly and 2014’s The Interview and a Reebok commercial where the former Victoria’s Secret model Miranda Kerr disrobes to her sneakers. Originally written as a riff on a 1966 Toots and the Maytals hit, the song has a simple, almost subliminal quality, like something schoolgirls might chant while jumping rope. Like a lot of early dancehall, it parallels early rap—listen to it alongside Roxanne Shante’s ""Roxanne’s Revenge"", for example, another song by a young woman who sounds both brashly confident and naïve. —Mike Powell",Belly,100,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Violent Femmes,“Blister in the Sun”,1983,"Has anything so ugly ever been this catchy? Piggybacking on one of the more unforgettable riffs in rock history, the equally memorable chorus of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in the Sun"" throws Gordon Gano’s un-redemptive sneer into whining, yelping overdrive. The single is the crowning moment on a self-titled debut album full of snotty gutter punk that gained a slow but steady following until it achieved platinum status nearly a decade after being released. That extended climax might seem antithetical to the commonly understood meaning of ""Blister"", which is often interpreted as an ode to masturbation, or premature ejaculation. But really, the song’s enigmatic lyrics remain more of an impressionistic dada explosion than anything that can be diagrammed and explicated. (Gano himself has said there’s nothing much there to actually make sense of.)",Times,99,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Chaka Khan / Rufus,“Ain't Nobody”,1983,"If you were going just off the lyric sheet, ""Ain’t Nobody"" might seem like something straight out of the '50s teenybopper-romantic songbook—stars are flown through, hearts are filled by a kiss, surrender is sweet. On record, the song tells a completely different story. Chaka doesn’t sound happy about the fact that there’s only one person in the world who can make her happy—in fact she sounds distraught over it. Behind her, Rufus has ditched the thick organic funk that they made their name on and gone all-in on the first wave of digital synthesis, and her vocals soar over an icy, thin, and rigidly clean electronic arrangement that only adds to the feeling of alienation. Mobs of post-disco soul acts would follow Rufus down the digital synth-funk path, and since R&B’s recently become the go-to genre for artists tinkering with pop’s sonic DNA, and tinny digital synths have floated back into fashion, there’s a whole new wave of musicians doing the same thing. The song’s greatest accomplishment isn’t the instrumentation, though—it’s the way the whole thing somehow manages to transmute wrung-out romantic desperation into pure ecstasy. —Miles Raymer",Control,98,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Cherrelle / Alexander O'Neal,“Saturday Love”,1985,"Everyone else had youthful sexuality covered, but with the form of the duet, mid-'80s R&B claimed as its very own the realm of adult romance. There was Dennis Edwards & Siedah Garret’s slinky and eerie ""Don’t Look Any Further"" in 1984; René & Angela’s seductively strutting ""I’ll Be Good"" a year later; and, perhaps best of all, ""Saturday Love"", 1985’s classiest single by some measure.",Control,97,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Grace Jones,“Pull Up to the Bumper”,1981,"By the '80s, Grace Jones was already undergoing a chameleonic artistic evolution. She’d moved from Paris back to New York and shifted her sound from disco to reggae-influenced rock and pop, contorting each genre into new, unexpected shapes that all had one pressing, common through-line: they demanded that you move to them. Although 1980's Warm Leatherette was met with lukewarm reviews, when Nightclubbing came a year later her foothold as an international icon was firmly established, with the album’s most controversial single, the seductive, dubby ""Pull Up to the Bumper"", doubling as its best. Born out of a Warm Leatherette session in the Bahamas with reggae rhythm section Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, the song evokes an erotic fixation for cars that edges on J.G. Ballard levels of obsession: there’s greasing, spraying, lubricating, long limousines, and, of course, that nominal bumper. Some radio stations refused to play the song because of its sexual undertones, but Jones, in perfectly Jonesian fashion, didn’t seem to care. She was already a lightning rod for attention at this point, and was often criticized for her gender-binary-ignoring appearance—""The future is no sex,"" she's said. Radio aside, ""Bumper"" turned out to be undeniable, infiltrating dance clubs upon a 1985 re-release and becoming a touchstone for post-disco and later innuendo-laden singles from Lady Gaga, Basement Jaxx, Rihanna and more. —Eric Torres",Warm Leatherette,96,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Change,“The Glow of Love”,1980,"While it wasn't his first appearance on wax—Gregg Diamond's ""Hot Butterfly"" predates ""The Glow of Love"" by two years—Luther Vandross' vocal performance on ""The Glow of Love"" was the first to harness the singer's larger-than-life wellspring of emotion. Whatever Change were, on ""The Glow of Love"", they were Luther Vandross' supporting band first and foremost. The album from which this record is culled is full of powerful records; ""Angel in My Pocket"" was a favorite of Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan, ""A Lover's Holiday"" is a disco classic, and ""The End"" was a proto-Italo record. But ""Searching"" and the title track nearly overshadow them, if only because Vandross had just begun to spread his wings: this was a star, and soon the world would know his name.",The Joshua Tree,95,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
U2,“With or Without You”,1987,"By 1987, Bono was already known as an ecstatic live performer unafraid of the grand gesture; during U2's Live Aid set two years earlier, he famously ran across the massive Wembley Arena stage before venturing toward the crowd in order to slow dance with a fan. The moment occurred as the quartet played ""Bad"", a song that helped bring dewy atmosphere and slow-rolling builds into the realm of arena rock. ""With or Without You"", the first single off of The Joshua Tree, distills the quiet power of ""Bad"" while flipping its gravitational force—instead of shamelessly reaching out for attention, Bono stands in one place in the song's video, as if his feet are crazy glued to the floor. He wants everyone to come to him.",The Joshua Tree,94,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Fleetwood Mac,“Gypsy”,1982,"The lore of the excess Fleetwood Mac indulged in at their height of their fame is the stuff of rock legend, a yardstick by which the hedonism of all other bands is measured (save for the Eagles). Amid the unstoppable worldwide post-Rumours ascent of the band, Stevie Nicks penned ""Gypsy"", a pean to before. Back when she was living in a tiny apartment in the Bay Area, waitressing to support herself and then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham, back when her best friend and voice coach Robin Snyder was alive. Likely written for the sessions for Nicks’ solo debut Bella Donna, the song eventually surfaced on the band’s 1982 album Mirage, and was characteristic of the more synthetic and slick Mac sound of the '80s. The video for ""Gypsy"" was, at the time, the most expensive music video ever made, and the first ""world premiere"" on MTV. While stadium bands lamenting the humble simplicity of their basement days is a codified part of rock'n'roll, what is really happening here is that Stevie Nicks is singing about her own life and herself in relationship to another woman, about female friendship. Women recording and performing personal songs that they wrote and sang was a relatively new phenomena in rock'n'roll; a hit song authored by a woman about her own creative life and the primacy of another woman in it—the regard of the ""my"" and ""she"" in ""Gypsy""—was almost unheard of—and what makes the song a landmark. —Jessica Hopper",Rumours,93,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
"Bill Withers / Grover Washington, Jr.",“Just the Two of Us”,1981,"In the early '70s, Bill Withers came out of the gate with three smash hits in a 16-month span: ""Ain’t No Sunshine"", ""Use Me"", and ""Lean on Me"". After the hot start, he quickly plateaued, remaining a mainstay on the R&B charts and urban radio but struggling to recapture his early success. He was finally able to strike gold again in 1981, accompanied by soul-jazz saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr., on the smooth jazz ballad ""Just the Two of Us"". A Grammy winner for Best R&B Song, the track finds Withers at his most inviting, welcoming in both lyric and tone. The saxophone has always been the sultriest of woodwind instruments but, when paired with Withers’ hearty timbre, it turns majestic, soaring through the lower octaves and building castles in the sky. —Sheldon Pearce",American Gigolo,92,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Blondie,“Call Me”,1980,"Debbie Harry's greatest strength as a singer is her uncanny ability to sound aloof and emotional at the same time and, on ""Call Me"", she sounds as tough as anybody in a state of detached cool could be. Give a little of that credit to producer Giorgio Moroder, who put together a synth-washed hard rock robo-stomp that incinerated AOR pretenders on contact. Give a little more credit to that knuckle-slinging Chris Stein riff, which actually notches an unlikely Who Wore It Better victory against Black Sabbath's ""Children of the Grave"" and unspools into an octane-burner of a solo near the end of the eight-minute full-length version.",American Gigolo,91,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

And then he wrote a 23-minute song about it. Released in 1981, ""Coffin for Head of State"" is one of several tracks Fela recorded in response to that 1977 attack on his Kalakuta compound. By then, Obasanjo had had enough of the outspoken, pot-smoking political dissident, and he was sick of the medium the man had invented to carry the message: Afrobeat.

"Evelyn ""Champagne"" King",“Love Come Down”,1982,"In the 1980s, with the advent of electronics and the shifting texture of popular music, certain producers—from Quincy Jones to Nile Rodgers, Jam & Lewis to Stock Aitken Waterman—became synonymous with certain sonic signatures. Despite his huge influence, one of the most undersung in this category was Kashif Saleem. A solo artist, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and songwriter who'd begun his career at age 15 playing keyboards for disco group B.T. Express, Kashif joined the Mighty M production trio alongside Paul Laurence and Morrie Brown in the early 1980s; with Mighty M and solo, he was in large part responsible for shaping the sound of '80s R&B—and by extension, much of popular music—in disco's wake.

Tracy Chapman,“Fast Car”,1988,"Working class narratives might not chart anymore, but escapism has long been universal. Tracy Chapman’s breakout single—the one she is remembered for most, to this day, along with 1997’s ""Give Me One Reason""—was a multi-character study about keeping sane, keeping safe and keeping a dream alive amidst long odds. The politics and plaintive gait of ""Fast Car"" echoes the simple, guitar-led soul of Bill Withers, who holds his working class roots close, even today. Chapman grew up in recession-era Cleveland but the determinism of a refrain like, ""I had a feeling that I belonged, I had a feeling that I could be someone,"" made it an anthem for all: kids stuck in bum towns and broken homes, single moms, desk drones, and dreamers. (Maybe even a few Reaganites?) Its release toward the end of the decade, as the artifice of new wave and glam rock were being phased out and hip-hop was making itself known, makes ""Fast Car"" one of the musical catalysts for the resurgence of liberalism and counterculture in the radical '90s. —Anupa Mistry",Reign in Blood,87,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Luther Vandross,“Never Too Much”,1981,"As any true karaoke specialist knows, ""Never Too Much"" is one of the world's worst karaoke records. Its melody—repetitive, predictable, over alternating, familiar block chords—lacks any kind of built-in tension. One can't merely hit the marks and pull off a convincing performance. Even though it's an uptempo pop record—perhaps the most accessible of Vandross' long and varied career—it's also a classicist's R&B cut, the magic tied directly to its performer's preternaturally fluid vocal control. This is why ""Never Too Much"" is also proof of Luther Vandross' tremendous, singular talent. Every drop of its ebullient emotion, those feelings deep enough to swim in, are contained within his incomparable voice. He embodies every second of each line, gives each turn of phrase, each syllable, a subtle, glancing grace. This delicate style lays confidently but gently upon this much less subtle musical backdrop, as if the suggestion of anything so selfish as carnality might disturb the sincerity of his devotion. ""Never Too Much"" is not the apex of Vandross as a singer even on his own debut; ""A House Is Not A Home"" more fully illustrates the depth and power of his vulnerable generosity. Yet within the broad strokes of its funk groove, which hand-holds listeners into a feeling of giddy celebration, Vandross' own voice limns his ecstasy in the aching sadness of its absence—the recognition that love is a surrender of control. —David Drake",Reign in Blood,86,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Slayer,“Angel of Death”,1986,"Slayer, looped in with Anthrax, Megadeth, and Metallica as part of the ""big four"" of thrash, took early inspiration from both British heavy metal and punk—throughout their career they’ve covered Minor Threat, the Exploited, GBH, and T.S.O.L, among others. In the spirit of their heroes, their third album, 1986’s Reign in Blood, came off like a blunt kick to the head. It was the first metal release for Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons’ Def Jam imprint, and Rubin recorded and produced it, stripping the Southern California quartet’s sound to its barest essentials, echoing the hardcore they’d grown up with, then speeding it up and making it more evil. Further rejecting concessions, they opened Reign in Blood with their most controversial track, the buzzing, pounding ""Angel of Death"".",Reign in Blood,85,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

My Bloody Valentine's album-length shoegaze masterwork is 1991's Loveless, but the title track from 1988's You Made Me Realise is the Kevin Shield-led Irish band's most emblematic song.

Tears for Fears,“Everybody Wants to Rule the World”,1985,"With their debut record The Hurting, Tears for Fears rivaled Morrissey as the poster children for '80s, British, sad-sack pop—the record was a wailing and gloomy new wave exploration into bloodshed, childhood suffering, and mental breakdowns. And while the band’s second album, Songs from the Big Chair, wasn’t too far a leap in terms of tone (the title was inspired by the psychological melodrama Sybil), musically it was a refined deep dive into a pure-pop sound that would make them famous.",The Hurting,83,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Diana Ross,“Upside Down”,1980,"Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers of Chic produced Diana Ross’ 1980 album Diana, but, before its release, the record was remixed without their permission: Ross' voice was moved to the forefront, the bass was reduced, the songs made flatter. Listening to the original Chic mixes of the album can feel like breathing oxygen into compressed airspace; like an unlatched accordion, the original mix unfolds to take up more space. Of course, either version is masterful: a concept record about falling for someone whose love isn't entirely reciprocated, of surrendering control. On ""Upside Down"", her words ring with the confidence of someone who's chosen acceptance: ""Respectfully, I say to thee, I'm aware that you're cheating,"" she sings, as if afraid of upsetting the balance. It's a song about that sensation of ""falling""—a term far too shortsighted to encapsulate the upside-down, inside-out, round-and-round motion of a crush. So just as Edwards and Rodgers’ songwriting suggests a box tumbling down stairs, Ross stands tall inside, enjoying the ride and fearing the landing. —David Drake",Diana,82,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Zapp,“Computer Love”,1986,"Roger Troutman called his talk box the Ghetto Robot or the Electric Country Preacher; his longtime friend Bootsy Collins called it the Cosmic Communicator, the mythological equivalent to MJ’s sequined glove, a drug addiction: ""We were able to translate this unspeakable sign language into street talk, on-the-corner croonin', babble, and liquid lovemaking... It is forbidden for you to know the secrets. It will always be a mystery."" By ""Computer Love"", Troutman’s family band Zapp had already optimized the golden ratio of bounce to ounce and laid the blueprint for g-funk even more directly than Parliament, but spiritual advisor George Clinton had dipped and album sales were tanking. But then there was ""Computer Love"": that rare, logic-defying union of man and crudely-rigged machine where the latter only heightens the humanity of the former (a balance later mastered by '05 T-Pain, '08 Lil Wayne, and '12 Future Hendrix), power lines sparking in a quiet storm. Credit due to Shirley Murdock and brother Larry Troutman, both co-writers, but the android romance was all Roger—a guy who re-learned the spoken alphabet to better fuse with he and his brothers’ homemade talk boxes that regularly electrocuted him and fucked up his stomach. He was a martyr for the funk in every sense; 14 years later, Larry fired four shots into his brother and then killed himself behind their Dayton, Ohio family studio. But first, and for years thereafter, ""Computer Love"" wedged its way into not just West coast rap legend, but to NYC, Chicago, Baton Rouge, and presumably out into the cosmos. —Meaghan Garvey",Melody Maker,81,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Boogie Down Productions,“South Bronx”,1986,"When Queens legends Marley Marl and MC Shan, members of the famed Juice Crew, released ""The Bridge"" in 1985 they didn’t know they’d be starting a firestorm. The record was meant to simply big up their borough, but it was misinterpreted by KRS-One as revisionist history. It’s well-established that the Bronx is the birthplace of hip-hop, but in ""The Bridge"", MC Shan seems to imply otherwise: “You love to hear the story again and again/ Of how it all got started way back when/ The monument is right in your face/ Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place."" If Queensbridge was falsely claiming the rap birthright as its own on wax, then that would be tantamount to a formal attack on the Bronx legacy and a full-on declaration of inner city war. The Boogie Down Productions response was swift. In 1986, BDP released the thumping, Shan-slamming ""South Bronx"", which was equal parts dis record and hometown anthem.",Melody Maker,80,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Specials,“Ghost Town”,1981,"On the surface, the Specials were an '80s reggae band that grew out of the racially egalitarian two-tone movement, but in essence were more like the Kinks: sharp-minded English guys who used satire to illustrate the ironies of their social world. Released during a deep recession and string of inner-city riots, ""Ghost Town"" was a grotesque musical-theater number that took the metaphor of its title literally, weaving spooky organs and lonesome, quasi-Arabian flutes into bleak, monochromatic dub. It became a hit, which is surprising only because it’s so unrepentantly grim—an instance where pop music didn’t just reflect the fantasies of a society, but the realities. In a little bit of contextual poetry, the band was in the process of breaking up. During sessions, members stood at the edges of the room, not speaking; at one point, one of the guitarists tried to kick a hole in the studio wall.

Whereas that manifested in the Sunset Strip scene in conquests, both sexual and pharmaceutical, Metallica wanted to elevate thrash metal beyond its origins as a hybrid of the new wave of British heavy metal and hardcore. They already had a stronger grip on arrangements and songwriting than virtually all of their peers when Kill 'Em All came out, but 1986’s Master of Puppets, and its title track especially, remains the hallmark of metal as a creative force to this day.",Kill 'Em All,78,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

In many ways, the band’s sound and character had already been defined. Still, Damaged is the Black Flag album that most people turn to first. Damaged’s opening track, ""Rise Above"", is a suitable argument for the record’s enduring importance. It’s Black Flag at its most anthemic—a rallying cry that stands as the polar opposite to the inward-looking album-closing title track. It’s also the band’s first recording with then new singer, Henry Rollins.

""You could have done it, you asshole, we could have fucking done it!"" Only years later did Barlow realize that Dinosaur never could have matched Nirvana's commercial appeal, but it's not a stretch to imagine them coming close.

Pixies,“Debaser”,1989,"""Debaser"" opens Pixies’ second album, Doolittle, a record that sounded more polished, in a good way, than its 1988 predecessor Surfer Rosa, and somehow felt educational. On ""Debaser"", Frank Black referenced Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali’s 1929 silent surrealist short film Un Chien Andalou with a line about slicing up eyeballs, and echoed the film’s title with the repeated ""un chien andalusia,"" a joking mix of English, Spanish, French, and invented nonsense. It was the first time many of us heard about Surrealism, and we were just as naïve and over-intellectual, proud and posing as Black seemed to be—it came to define something about consciously taking the path less traveled, one that may involve seeming degraded or debased to brighter, shinier folk. ""Debaser"" jams what Pixies do best into under three minutes of Black’s wildman vocals, Kim Deal’s ethereal echoes and sturdy bass, Joey Santiago’s angular, earworm guitars, Dave Lovering’s punched-up drums, all locking together seamlessly.

Bad Brains,“Pay to Cum”,1982,"Bad Brains had many contemporaries on the early '80s hardcore punk circuit, but few actual peers. ""Pay to Cum"" first appeared on a 7'' single in 1980, and though it was technically predated by other hardcore singles such as Black Flag’s ""Nervous Breakdown"", there is no question that it is one of the cornerstones upon which the entire genre was built. With their background in jazz fusion, the Brains were simply better and more versatile musicians than nearly anyone else in their field, and every element of their musical approach was always a notch or two beyond what early hardcore listeners had any right to expect. Their rhythm section was lithe and muscular, guitarist Dr. Know was one of the rare ""punk"" musicians to develop his own distinctive signature guitar tone, and charismatic frontman H.R. was able to slip his voice elusively between octaves and punctuate his live performances with perfectly executed backflips.","Well, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night…",73,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Prince,“When You Were Mine”,1980,"Before there was Sign 'o' the Times, before there was Purple Rain, there was Dirty Mind. The album that Prince started the '80s off with, essentially a collection of bedroom demos, was simultaneously his most innocuous and his most brash. It featured surprisingly graphic sounds about incest, oral sex, and other sordid subjects, with the fidelity and scope of a bedroom demo one-man-band. ""When You Were Mine"", which softened his trademark funk into something closer to jangle pop, was one of the most shocking turns on the whole record. What starts as a typical I-want-you-back-lament turns a corner quickly: ""You let all my friends come over and meet/ And you were so strange/ You didn't have the decency to change the sheets."" That'll raise an eyebrow or two. And then there's the ""I never was the kind to make a fuss/ When he was there/ Sleeping in between the two of us,"" all presented with the same doe-eyed expression.

Biz Markie,“Just a Friend”,1989,"By definition, Biz Markie didn’t fit the standard of what rappers were supposed to be. In the era of Rakim, KRS-One, and Big Daddy Kane, Biz was the anti-lyricist. He was a DJ and beat boxer, so he was undoubtedly hip-hop, but his aesthetic was rooted in a comedy that connected with listeners on a raw level. Released in 1989, ""Just a Friend"" turned singer Freddie Scott’s ""You Got What I Need"" into a lovelorn anthem, the hook sung so terribly that you couldn’t help but embrace its gut-level emotion. And it had great lasting images: The beat itself had raw, hypnotic drums, and the video featured Biz in a Beethoven wig and blazer, banging out the keys. We never find out who the girl was that broke Biz’s heart. (Just call her Blah Blah Blah.) The lasting takeaway? ""Don’t ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend."" Who knew Biz was so profound? —Marcus J. Moore",not,69,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Guns N' Roses,“Sweet Child o' Mine”,1987,"You cannot discuss ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" without talking about the opening riff. It's tied to Slash's essence—to his mop, his shades, his Les Paul, his swing that's hard but not jagged, smooth but not sickeningly slick. Hating that riff is not an option. If it comes on rock radio, even if you know rock radio has contributed to the stagnation of mainstream rock, you perk up and you're not turning it off. Would-be ""guitar heroes"" at Guitar Center can't diminish it. Legions of no-time white-collar bros at karaoke bars who couldn't imitate Axl Rose's sway even if his tight white shorts were grafted onto their skin can't either. Not even a piss-ass performance at last year's Golden Gods could kill that riff.",not,68,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
The Replacements,“Alex Chilton”,1987,"Depending on what gossip you choose to believe, the late Alex Chilton may have thought Paul Westerberg tried too hard. Imagine the unshakably insouciant Westerberg, reduced to a fanboy in front of his hero. We're never as uncool as when it comes to what we love, and the Replacements frontman loved Big Star. In 1987, Big Star were still one of those obscure bands cited by heads wise enough to have snagged #1 Record, Radio City, or 3rd before they disappeared into the ether, or some other record head's collection. The Replacements, meanwhile, had just suffered their first serious lineup change, after kicking out lead guitarist Bob Stinson for being an alcoholic. They'd begun as snotty hardcore brats, become heart-on-sleeve drunkards unafraid to sing about androgyny and unrequited love, even signed to a major label in order to get as big as their friends in R.E.M. Only they remained on the fringe of the American mainstream: After releasing two perfect records, 1984's Let It Be and 1985's Tim, to nothing but acclaim from the heads and the college kids, it seemed they might risk becoming one of those bands that almost was.",#1 Record,67,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Echo & the Bunnymen,“The Killing Moon”,1984,"Formed during the late '70s in Liverpool, England, Echo & the Bunnymen’s music combined '60s psychedelic rock sprawl with post-punk experimentation. Its songs were seemingly guided forward by singer Ian McCulloch’s opaque and gloomy lyrics, rather than the other way around. By 1984’s Ocean Rain, the band—led by guitarist Will Sergeant and McCulloch— cast a more focused eye to pop structure and arrangement.",Ocean Rain,66,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
David Bowie,“Let’s Dance”,1983,"After tackling surreal folk, conceptual proto-punk, androgynous glam, plastic soul, and cocaine-fueled art rock, David Bowie was interested in making one thing in the early '80s: hits. Looking to pay postmodern tribute to the simple power of early rock'n'roll staples like ""Twist and Shout"", Bowie recruited Chic's Nile Rodgers, who was considered something of a disco casualty at the time, to help produce what would become 1983's Let's Dance. The initial sketch of the album's title track came from Bowie, though it was far from an obvious smash. ""It was not a song you could dance to,"" Rodgers has said, describing the folky demo. So the virtuoso musician switched out Bowie's strumming chords with sharp guitar stabs and made room for a groove that could enliven both elite downtown clubs and totally lame weddings—which is precisely what it's done ever since. The song remains Bowie's biggest-ever hit. His plan worked. —Ryan Dombal",Let's Dance,65,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Stevie Nicks,“Edge of Seventeen”,1982,"Stevie Nicks was a sucker for theatrics, but over half a decade in Fleetwood Mac had brought her too much of the wrong kind of drama. In 1981, she was dealing with Tusk's flabby 13-month gestation, Lindsey Buckingham's God complex, and a tour of Europe in Hitler's old train, which will do wonders for your coke-induced paranoia. Recorded live in the studio in just a few days, Nicks' solo debut Bella Donna marked her spiritual realignment, casting demons and scrubs (if not drugs) out. Lead single ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"" exorcised bad love; prompted by the almost simultaneous deaths of John Lennon and Nicks' uncle, ""Edge of Seventeen"" then looks inward to evaluate what really matters, and comes out honoring lost life through unparalleled determination.",Tusk,64,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Art of Noise,“Moments in Love”,1987,"A mutated difference-splitter between ambient and quiet storm, a track that turns euphoria and tension into facets of a mobius strip, the Dirty South precursor that lurked on the other side of its NYC-hip-hop pastiche A-side—there are a lot of dichotomies you could find in ""Moments in Love"", the flip of Art of Noise's debut single ""Beat Box"", but the one that lingers the most is its pull between minimalism and maximalism. Pure pop sentiment is reduced to a half-crawling, half-floating pulse of codeine electro and a simple phrase rendered as a wisp of smoke through 10-and-a-quarter minutes of meditative waviness. But the Fairlight orchestra stabs and the sighing, clenched-throat robot choir dig so deep that the slightest variation and deviation is nearly as bracing as a flashy solo or melismatic run. Parts fade in and out to shift emphasis from glimmering chimes to sinister bass, and the tenor of that insistent drum pattern flicks from a comforting pulse to the churn of industrial machinery; when the song takes an unexpected detour into minor-key melancholy, it's almost startling. It's as though ""Moments in Love"" was built for the very purpose of finding out how much you could subtract from a pop song while still being recognizably closer to pop than art—though ""Moments in Love"" is brilliant as both. —Nate Patrin",Music for the Masses,63,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Gang Starr,“DJ Premier in Deep Concentration”,1989,"Widely considered an all-time DJ track, the strength of ""DJ Premier in Deep Concentration"" does not lie in its technical acrobatics. Its scratches are clean, precise, and inventive, there's no doubt about that, but few scratching showcases manage to create a living, breathing world as effortlessly as Premier does here. That world is late-'80s New York, which is ironic considering that Martin was born in Houston and raised in Texas before ending up as one-half of the most influential—and most associated with New York—duos in rap history. On top of a relaxed yet hypnotic snatch of jazzy piano chords, Premo erects a tribute to his adopted city with his turntables, weaving together samples of everything from train whistles to Billy Stewart trilling to snippets of lines from other rappers, including (of course) his partner-in-crime, Guru. But it's all in service of a very specific atmosphere: ""DJ Premier in Deep Concentration"" conjures the last embers of a New York block party, where the smells of the food served earlier still linger as the dancers contort themselves into human blurs at the precise moment that dusk turns into night. —Renato Pagnani",Music for the Masses,62,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
ESG,“Moody”,1981,"The overlapping territory covered by post-punk and hip-hop—percussive, polyrhythmic, looped, sparse—is rarely occupied by one band that touches on all three in equal measure. ESG (Emerald, Sapphire, and Gold) was formed by sisters Renee, Valerie, Deborah, and Marie Scroggins in the early '80s, and they possessed a rare ability to not only touch all of those underground scenes, but have an indelible impact on their development. ""Moody"", produced by Factory Records’ Martin Hannett, also responsible for Joy Division’s groundbreaking sound, was their first single. Popular on club floors at the time, ""Moody” was sampled by house artists like Chicago’s Chip E. and Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk; by Belgian dance-pop duo Technotronic on their crossover radio hit, ""Get Up (Before the Night Is Over)""; by Tricky in the late '90s; and by indie rockers Radio 4 in the early '00s, among others. Artists from TLC to Wu-Tang have sampled other ESG songs, and Kathleen Hanna and Jennifer Herrema of Royal Trux cite the group among their influences. All in all, it’s a pretty incredible—and wholly earned—legacy for a family band raised on Motown and James Brown whose mother encouraged them to enter a talent show in South Bronx, where they lived and were discovered. —Jes Skolnik",Music for the Masses,61,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Depeche Mode,“Never Let Me Down Again”,1987,"By their sixth album, Depeche Mode had hit upon something like a groove. The snarkily-named Music for the Masses wasn’t packed with gold singles like its follow-up, Violator, but it saw a minor hit in its slinky track one, ""Never Let Me Down Again"". The song inched to #22 on the UK charts in 1987, but saw greater success outside the band’s home country. ""Never Let Me Down Again"" reached #2 in West Germany, three years before the wall splitting Germany in two would come down.",Music for the Masses,60,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Daryl Hall & John Oates,“I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)”,1981,"""I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)"" is a fascinating song on a number of levels: it was one of the earliest number ones to use a drum machine (the Roland CompuRhythm CR-78 to be exact), Daryl Hall's bassline directly inspired the groove on ""Billie Jean"", or so he claims the King of Pop once admitted to him, the song topped the R&B Billboard chart back when a white act doing so was much more of a blip on the radar than it is today (read Chris Molanphy's excellent feature ""I Know You Got Soul: The Trouble With Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Chart"" for a deeper analysis of the history of the R&B chart), and it's been sampled by almost everyone.

Eric B. & Rakim,“Follow the Leader”,1988,"First impressions rarely come as definitive as this: If Paid in Full didn't convince you of who Rakim was and why he became so revered, this is everything in his arsenal laid out over a masterpiece of synth-meets-breaks production. (Everyone else is sampling the riff from Bob James' ""Nautilus""? Fine: Eric B.'ll sample the ambience.) His flow is immaculate, rattling off run-on barrages of alliteration and internal rhyme schemes (""From century to century you'll remember me/ In history, not a mystery or a memory"") that are a striking Exhibit A if you want to make like Q-Tip's pops and draw a connection from rap vocals to bebop instrumentation. As claims to one's own skill go, it's impressively show-not-tell—his gift would be obvious if he spit in Esperanto—but what he tells is primo, a then-cocky, now-obvious monument to his sway over hip-hop. ""I can take a phrase that's rarely heard/ Flip it – now it's a daily word"" is just the start; he pulls you up into the reaches of space just to give dibs to his impact, invokes Five-Percent Nation philosophy to rewire black self-hatred out of the brain, and reduces competitors to game show contestants sweating for a piece of his prize.

Bob Marley & the Wailers,“Could You Be Loved”,1980,"It’s a staple of tourist trap playlists the world over, known for a flickering guitar lick and an unstoppable hook, but ""Could You Be Loved"" isn’t just a chipper follow-up to 1977’s ""One Love"". From Popcaan to Vybz Kartel, today’s Jamaican musicians have maintained reggae’s directive to raise up the people, but it was Marley—by then, a true rock star—and his bandmates who helped elevate the message beyond the conservative confines of their home island and into the realm of global pop. Included on the group’s final album, Uprising, with the more overtly political ""Redemption Song"", ""Could You Be Loved"" spoke on Marley’s devotion to Rastafari and was a call-to-arms against Babylon (the system that maintains oppression and its agents) in Jamaica and abroad. ""Don’t let them fool ya/ Or even try to school ya, oh no!/ We’ve got a mind of our own."" Pushing back on the encroaching disorder of laissez-faire economics through his music, Marley became a target of Cold War-era suspicion and—as Marlon James alludes to in his sprawling, 2015 American Book Award-winning crime novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings—even the CIA.

New Order,“Ceremony”,1981,"""Ceremony"" holds a peculiar place in New Order’s oeuvre: It was their debut single, but also one of the last songs Ian Curtis wrote for Joy Division. It’s devastating even without that context. The only relic of Curtis on the track was a fuzzy live recording of a performance at Birmingham University 16 days before his death. It was so hard to decipher that Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook had to rewrite some of the vague lyrics, which paint a picture of fatigue, death, and never-ending love. The song plays like it’s wearing a leash, with each ""oh I’ll break them down, no mercy shown,"" chorus disobeying the rest of the track’s peace. And there’s a tedious, muted quality that feels mechanical; no riff, drum-kick, or cold Sumner-does-Curtis utterance overpowers any other part of the song, each note occupying the same amount of silence.",Rio,56,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Roxy Music,“More Than This”,1982,"Starting with its 1972 debut, Roxy Music built a bridge between prog and glam, laying the foundation for the most ostentatious British punk while signed to King Crimson’s management company, E.G. After a remarkable five-album run (the first two featuring an oft-befeathered Brian Eno), the group took a hiatus in 1976, reforming for a two-album binge with a slimmed-down lineup that concluded in 1980. Bandleader Bryan Ferry, who’d released five solo albums during Roxy’s tenure and hiatus, wasn’t quite done yet, though. Working with a concept built around King Arthur being whisked off to the enchanted mythical island of Avalon after his death, Ferry holed up for months, emerging with the band’s biggest single that bested the year’s crop of louche, MTV-aiming new wavers at their own game.",Rio,55,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

In that form, it's something to be snarled rather than belted out. The studio version from the same era, recorded by Martin Hannett, put all the muscle in the guitar riffs, placing the emphasis on the thrust rather than the hover. Fast forward four years later, through innumerable false starts, and the Manchester band had finally landed a proper record deal and made their debut album.

Neneh Cherry,“Buffalo Stance”,1988,"What history gets wrong about ""Buffalo Stance"" is locating it as the 1980s moment for ""feminist"" rap, a tag Neneh Cherry sloughed off at the time. Rather, Cherry was at the vanguard of a particular zeitgeist, of young black women infusing both the club and the street into pop songs. ""Buffalo Stance"" peaked Stateside in April 1989. By the end of the year, there were plenty of similar successes: Technotronic’s ""Pump Up the Jam"" with Belgian MC Ya Kid K, Queen Latifah’s ""Ladies First (ft. Monie Love)"" and ""Come Into My House"", Soul II Soul’s hit with Caron Wheeler, ""Back II Life"". Cherry’s song navigated dualities that stoked curiosity about her: rapping and singing, in both an American and a London accent, lyrics that were cocky but had heart. In the video, she was feminine and tough, in her doorknockers and flight jacket, mocking some dude who thought he could play her. The street tableau Cherry narrates, of a boy with a gold tooth and Lacoste kicks putting women on the corner as a come up, was one that was much more familiar to hip-hop than it was to Top 40 (hip-hop’s presence in the mainstream was still nascent, ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was less than a year old), let alone in a year dominated by hits by Paula Abdul, Roxette, and Mike & the Mechanics’ ""The Living Years"".

Brash, blocky keyboard notes jump out from the back of the arrangement like external stressors, only to be constrained by Jam and Lewis’ ultra-tight rhythms: Nothing can penetrate her cocoon of affection.

The Jesus and Mary Chain,“Just Like Honey”,1985,"Led by a couple of sneering, big-haired Scottish brothers who always seemed on the verge of punching each other’s lights out, the Jesus and Mary Chain provided a blueprint for bands fascinated with burying familiar pop tropes under so many decibels of feedback and sonic sludge. Though their debut album, Psychocandy, is notable for all its high-volume sonic bluster, the Mary Chain’s most famous single is also its softest. A paean to the mythical girl who ""takes on half the world"" and lives inside some kind of magisterial beehive, ""Just Like Honey"" is a classic bad boy love song—a reverby dose of Phil Spector grandiosity that sounds as if it might have been recorded in a smoky cave. Thirty years later, the song remains swoon-worthy in spite of itself. Hearing frontman Jim Reid go on about how ""eating up the scum is the hardest thing for me to do"" might not be most obvious of romantic admissions, but it’s hard to argue with a skinny guy in black leather who repeatedly promises ""I’ll be your plastic toy"" as if his life depended on it. And even though the track has been co-opted over the years by the likes of Sofia Coppola, Volkswagen, and Scarlett Johansson, there are still few things in the musical cosmos that sound more oddly tender than hearing the song’s titular hook over and over as guitar lines crackle and fade behind it. ""Just Like Honey"" certainly isn’t the Jesus and Mary Chain’s loudest moment, but it is undeniably their sweetest. —T. Cole Rachel",Psychocandy,47,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
De La Soul,"“Me, Myself and I”",1989,"With ""Me, Myself and I"", De La Soul were immediately received by the press as the positive alternative to more confrontational hip-hop acts. The song's Funkadelic sample was smooth and uplifting compared to Public Enemy's more jarring sampling techniques. But the irony to ""Me, Myself and I""—the ultimate song of self-acceptance—is that the group made it at their label's request and it was meant to to convey exactly what they weren't. In a track-by-track review with Rolling Stone for the album's 20th anniversary, Posdnuos explained they had to make a song for the album that ""isn't so over someone's head."" Trugoy the Dove elaborated, ""Originally, it was us trying to make sure we're saying we're not hippies."" In their effort to simplify and clarify, De La found the thesis within their music.

""Close to Me"" is the peak of the latter period: a festive love song caught in the middle of a panic attack, a song about happiness and erotic bliss sung from the point of view of somebody who's still convinced that it's all about to be ripped away (""if only I was sure that my head on the door was a dre-he-heam,"" Smith hiccup-moans). Smith's voice is right up in your face, with the arrangement's handclaps and heavy breathing almost indistinguishable from the sound of someone leaning in to confide something in confidence. He rolls his words around his mouth, as if he's figuring out if they're delicious or disgusting or both; his lyrics incorporate some of the most freighted words from the first few Cure albums (""sick,"" ""faith,"" ""clean""—remember, this is a man who three years earlier had made ""I will never be clean again"" the hook of a song).",The Head on the Door,41,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

For all the emotional bleakness (described as ""feelings buried, persisting in anxious dreams and suppressed fear, hope and anger,"" in Martin Aston's 4AD tome Facing the Other Way), it’s always been, to me, something too exquisitely nostalgic to haunt. ""Lorelei"" is a fuzzy encounter in the record’s lucid dream, that rare experience of discovery without fear, lust minus urgency.

Salt-n-Pepa,“Push It”,1987,"""Push It"" is one of those rare songs that gets revived with such frequency that you can still come into contact with it accidentally about as often now as you could when it was first released. Over the past decade it’s been reclaimed by a staggeringly broad range of socio-musical groups that encompasses everything from electroclashers to hip-hop nostalgists, underground queer dance parties to fratty '80s retro nights. That kind of ubiquity has its downfalls, namely the kind of dull familiarity that comes with being able to hear a track any weekend for years and years at a time. Listen to it with fresh ears, though, and ""Push It"" reveals itself to be a radically out-there song–a razor blade of the '80s electronic avant garde smuggled into the pop culture mainstream disguised as bubblegum. You’ve heard the song so many times that you probably don’t even remember that half of it is instrumental, just a beat that hovers in some indistinct space between late-'80s rap and late-'80s dance music, and that works equally well when mixed in with Miami freestyle or German industrial. And when Salt and Pepa do take the mic their performance is more forceful than anything this side of Chuck D–clusters of clipped, half-shouted syllables that demolish the preceding century’s ideals of how female performers should conduct themselves on record with a forceful sexuality that makes Madonna (not to mention Big Daddy Kane) seem like a wallflower by comparison.

It was a furtive, optimistic, uncertain time, the time of Fab 5 Freddy, Keith Haring, graffiti artist Futura; the time of French culture scavengers like Jean Karakos, who came to New York to form Celluloid Records because of the fascinating American records reaching his stores; it was the time of Debbie Harry, Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash.

Its weirdness is also contextual, because from this point forward, Michael Jackson’s blockbuster ballads were pleas to save the world or the children or the whales.

""Quiet storm"" had existed as an idea since Smokey Robinson, and there it is at the heart of the song’s chorus: ""There’s a quiet storm, and it’s never felt like this before."" Given that Sade’s immense popularity coincided with the time when the R&B subgenre/soft-rock analogue would crest in the public’s awareness, it’s tempting to read it and the song as somehow encapsulating what this ""quiet storm,"" and what it could be.

Prince and the Revolution,“I Would Die 4 U”,1984,"Purple Rain was Prince’s sixth record and the most potent of that legendary run of Dirty Mind, Controversy, and 1999. It sold about 13 million copies in the U.S. alone, and right there, right after ""Darling Nikki"" and ""When Doves Cry"", is arguably the heaviest song in his catalog: ""I Would Die 4 U"", with its propulsive industrial heartbeat. ""I Would Die 4 U"" is a brooding wall of sound that rips through about three genres in under three minutes—one of the shortest, densest tracks of Prince’s career. Known for chasing his sometimes flighty inner muse, Prince envisions himself as a Christ-like figure, turning an ostensible feel-good love song into a messianic anthem, down to its repeated titular pleading, where he re-casts the song, his music, himself as other-worldly. In a long career full of dramatic reinventions, ""I Would Die 4 U"" stands out as the time Prince most urgently made his intentions known. —Matthew Ramirez",Purple Rain,34,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
N.W.A,“Fuck tha Police”,1988,"From one vantage, N.W.A’s story is one of rebellion against surveillance—over-patrolled neighborhoods, racial profiling, closed-circuit cameras—in which the surveilled turn the means of representation back on the state-sanctioned powers-that-be. It was ironic, if not infuriating, then, that the opening weekend of the group’s myth-burnishing Straight Outta Compton film was itself the subject of unnecessary state-sanctioned scrutiny. ""In light of everything that’s going on, we are dispatching additional officers to theaters that are showing the film,"" an LAPD officer told Variety.

He became the music director at the Warehouse, a safe space for gay men of color to hear the craziest music until noon the next day. (Today, the unassuming West Loop corner is bookended by a yoga studio and an Al’s Beef.) Knuckles’ no-rules sets there invented what we know as house, but no house records were getting pressed or distributed during the Warehouse’s existence. (He left and opened his own club, the Power Plant, around '82; the first house record, Jesse Saunders’ ""On and On"", hit wax in '84.)

The attitude may have been their own, but just about everything else, from the slash-and-scratch production and the hair-metal guitars to the trio’s Run-D.M.C. cadences, came on loan from Def Jam’s Rick Rubin collection. It’s no wonder they wanted to leave the label to explore less charted territory, and in the maximalist, proto-big-beat production of the Los Angeles duo the Dust Brothers, they found the original vision they were looking for.

It’s taken from a seance scene in the 1957 horror classic Night of the Demon, in which a devilish monstrosity—part ape, part bat, all charmingly ridiculous—forces a bunch of eggheads to consider the existence of supernatural phenomena.

Janet Jackson,“Love Will Never Do (Without You)”,1989,"There isn’t a modern analog for the fearless daring of Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814 album cycle. Dressed in stark monochrome and executing choreography that resembled hand-to-hand combat more than traditional hip-hop dance, Jackson chased her 1986 breakthrough Control with a brash political gambit. ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"" seems to hang back on the seriousness of Rhythm Nation’s social consciousness in favor of a simple song of devotion—though ""simple"" does this towering six-minute epic very little justice. Everything in the mix hits like percussion, and Janet’s voice glides coolly over top as she celebrates her lover while sneakily letting him know she could have anyone she wants. Beyoncé stepping out in 1814 gear on a recent Halloween night confirmed what some of us suspected all along: Homegirl’s been taking notes. —Craig Jenkins",Rhythm Nation 1814,28,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Public Enemy,“Bring the Noise”,1987,"Emerging in fall 1987 as part of the Less Than Zero soundtrack, ""Bring the Noise"" would anchor It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Public Enemy’s totemic sophomore album, the following June. And from Flavor Flav’s hype-man taunts to Chuck D’s granite-solid sixteens to the Bomb Squad’s flurrying jazzbo squall, every aspect of ""Noise"" still stings like a provocation, a dare, a saber rattling before it carves your speakers from the inside. Verses unspool in a flood as turbulent as the production, baiting radio DJs, critics, and audience alike with a breathlessness that suggests they’re rapping through the crowd and into hip-hop posterity. A fleet fluidity informs Chuck D’s flow here, effortless in a dizzying, dazzling way—he’s circling us like a young prize fighter, landing one swift, sure blow after another. It’s exhaustive and inexhaustible, a playful mission statement that dials back somewhat on the agenda-setting, making space for shouts to Sonny Bono, Yoko Ono, and Anthrax, who would memorably cover the song with Public Enemy a few years hence. The group was just warming, and it’s telling that 28 years on, ""Noise"" remains more mesmerizing than the vast majority of rap anthems that would follow it. —Raymond Cummings",Less Than Zero,27,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
New Order,“Temptation”,1982,"Specific feelings can become tied to the pop music of a specific decade: The '90s were good for angst and self-loathing; the '70s were ripe for hedonism; and the '80s were a bountiful time for yearning. Through some combination of new synthesizer sounds, new haircuts, and the new image of teen-dom as seen in the movies of John Hughes, a large handful of songs from this era articulated an almost painful desire for someone or something that was just out of reach. New Order’s ""Temptation"" is the greatest song about this feeling ever written.",so,26,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Pixies,“Where Is My Mind?”,1988,"Presaging the alt-rock boom that came at the beginning of the next decade, 1988's ""Where Is My Mind?"" is a distinctly prescient late-'80s landmark and a song that launched a thousand Nirvanas. As one of the bigger hits off of Surfer Rosa, ""Where Is My Mind?"" invokes powerful, visceral, and oddly wistful sentiments all at once, using the song’s eponymous chorus as both an existential plea and a zany, lethargic rallying cry. Even the song’s production is manic: stark, spiraling guitar licks cohere with fretful acoustic guitar strums and the sound of a human howling, and Frank Black’s lyrics are sung in alternatingly high and low octaves—a delivery that is jarring and unhinged, but still strangely jubilatory. There’s a warmth and wry humor to the way the band’s synthesized textures placate the song’s narrative eccentricity. ""Where Is My Mind?"" is a funhouse mirror of angst and liberation, but few songs in the genre come as neatly packaged as this one. —Molly Beauchemin",Surfer Rosa,25,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Slick Rick,“Children’s Story”,1988,"With a voice like a deadpan British Bootsy Collins and a storytelling sense that could turn any situation into detailed vérité, Slick Rick built a reputation as an MC that thrived on the outsized. When you outline the narrative of ""Children's Story"", it seems pretty standard: a young man becomes a stick-up kid, attempts to rob and then runs from an undercover cop, gets into a high-speed gun battle, takes and releases a hostage, then finally surrenders once he's surrounded before being shot by the cops anyway. But few rappers before or since have shown Rick’s ability to inhabit multiple characters on this level—it's like a precursor to Kool G Rap's crime narratives filtered through an Eddie Murphy bit. All you have to do is quote certain phrases—""Me'n you, Ty, we gonna make some caaaaash"" or ""Daaaave, the dope fiend shooting dope"" or ""rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered""—to realize how deeply Rick's sing-song phrasing pulls you along, the quick-witted efficiency and smash-cut pacing turning out far more evocative than its music video ever could. —Nate Patrin",vérité,24,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Talking Heads,“This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)”,1983,"""This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"" was an aberration for the Talking Heads. It was more of an exercise in understated musical hypnosis than polyrhythmic, Kuti-quoting funk, well-compressed instead of bursting at the seams, and (in its abashed way) it was a full-blown love song. But it didn’t clear #50 on the Hot 100, despite the Heads’ commercial success with ""Burning Down the House"" a few months earlier. With ""This Must Be the Place"", the band simplified their sound dramatically, condensing their sonic palette to the level of small EKG blips (having switched instruments for a lark, this was nearly all they were able to reliably deliver chops-wise) and wringing out only a few chords.",eureka,23,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Prince and the Revolution,“Kiss”,1986,"After the commercial and artistic triumph of Purple Rain and the declaration of unpredictability that was Around the World in a Day, Prince cemented his reputation as a master innovator the moment ""Kiss"" pounced out of the radio in 1986. There was no other record that moved like it, and there still isn't. It's shockingly spare for a dance track: dry as ash, with all of its weightless bulk way up in the tweeter zone and no bassline at all. The song's structure and chords come off as unimaginably fresh and alien, which is pretty impressive considering that it's basically just a twelve-bar I-IV-V blues at its core. (The two covers of ""Kiss"" that were minor hits in the next few years—one by the Art of Noise with Tom Jones, the other by Age of Chance—made a point of how little they sounded like Prince's version, and how splendid a song it was anyway.)",Purple Rain,22,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Whitney Houston,“I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)”,1987,"""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"", released in 1987, is one of Houston’s most recognizable hits, and one that brings the contrast between the talent and the tabloid story into sharpest relief. It’s a bright, bubbly pop song, bopping through the standard-issue subject matter that is the single girl’s longing for the lighthearted fun of romantic love. Houston’s signature shout after the unmistakable keyboard intro is pure '80s joy, reminiscent of the similarly jubilant openings of both Cyndi Lauper’s ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" and Houston’s own ""How Will I Know"". This comparison did not go unnoticed when the song was first released, and critics used it as a reason to pan ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" as a lazy imitation of a formula Houston and Lauper had already gotten right. But the years have been kind to ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"". Houston, then on her second studio album, is youthful, light—the voice on the record is impossible to reconcile with the Houston the public came to know in the years surrounding her death.",Paid in Full,21,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

He disappeared to Maui, lived out of a van, and attempted suicide by blowing an ounce of coke in an hour. He quit Motown and moved to Belgium in '81, disillusioned and recently 40, desperate for redemption. His mind wandered to the Red Light District, Bob Marley, and Kraftwerk. He never wanted to make a Motown-sounding record again, and taught himself to play his new TR-808 and a Jupiter-8, an analog synth Roland had just introduced.

Though ""Waiting Room"" contains the same ferocity, pithiness, and efficiency you’d expect from a song written by members of Minor Threat and Rites of Spring, it’s more complicated than your average punk song was in those days. It’s no surprise that a remarkably diverse roster of artists have chosen to cover this particular anthem over the last several decades. As Fugazi themselves have become the standard-bearers of a strict DIY ethic, so a cover of ""Waiting Room"" immediately references those ethical roots and an idea of rock music created by and for a relatively small community of scrappy kids who are passionate, political, and thoughtful. While the band’s sound would continue to grow over the arc of its existence, ""Waiting Room"" is the song that first defined them, and continues to reverberate with fans new and old. —Jes Skolnik",Daydream Nation,17,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" sounds like a slogan embroidered on a pillow you’d find in some dusty bed and breakfast, but Morrissey imbued the phrase with vitality. He sings like someone holding on, even as he’s on the verge of collapse; the music is graceful yet firm, accentuated by a stirring synthetic string section. (Despite being a song where the singer moans about wanting to die in a car crash, it sounds excellent from inside a car.) There’s a moment of stunning humility in the lyrics, when the narrator imagines his death coming in a darkened underpass before ""a strange fear"" grips him, and he realizes he wants to live.

Michael Jackson,“Billie Jean”,1983,"We all know ""Billie Jean"", the song: Its insatiable hook and ribald bassline and Michael Jackson’s plaintive hics launched the pop star into a stratospheric realm of celebrity, decades ahead of reality TV stars and the 24-hour news cycle. Just as, if not more, important is ""Billie Jean"", the video. At the same time that Jackson’s gentle grin smiled out from magazine and newspaper covers all over the world, there were still racial barriers to breach at home in America. Directed by Steve Barron (who would go on to do A-Ha’s ""Take on Me""), the video was among the first by a black musician to air on MTV. It’s absurd to imagine, 30 years on, at a time when videos by black artists set trends, help keep cable music channels afloat, and are the cache driving emerging digital platforms like Tidal and Apple Music. Jackson’s music united people all over the world in an unprecedented way, but it was his image—his smooth brown skin, the glossy Jheri curl and infamous toe stand—that made ""Billie Jean"" so crucial to the commodification of black artists in pop music, and a progenitor of a culture that thrives on ""social media moments."" —Anupa Mistry","Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me",14,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Their discography, which now stretches back nearly 40 years, is a study in extremes—from the most abjectly bleak and funereal goth dirges to the giddiest of Technicolor pop. ""Just Like Heaven"" is gleefully the latter, three minutes of the most immaculate musical confectionary Robert Smith ever concocted. The third single from 1987’s willfully schizophrenic Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, ""Just Like Heaven"" was the first Cure song to crack the U.S. top 40, immediately serving as a kind of gateway drug for a generation of ""120 Minutes""-watching teen misanthropes eager to lap up the band’s black-eyelined majesty.

Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five,“The Message”,1982,"Amid the luxury high rises and organic eateries, it’s easy to forget that New York City in 2015 is only a generation removed from a different city entirely. Many of the same city streets lied undeveloped, little more than piles of rubble from dilapidated buildings and tenacious weeds snaking through the devastation, as indelicate urban planning shuttled the rich out of the city and folded the impoverished into cubbyhole apartments. Out of that wreckage, too, bloomed hip-hop. It was both an escape from the perils of an unsafe city and a method of speaking to them. The greatest early expression of hip-hop’s twin power as dance music and social commentary is Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five’s ""The Message"". Grandmaster Melle Mel cuts to the bloody quick in his opening verse, painting a picture of inner city disenfranchisement—from neighborhoods specked with bombed out buildings and the job market keeping minorities living in them, to the live wire desire to snap under the pressure of pretending these conditions are just the way of the world. It feels like an answer to Bob Dylan’s ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", casual observation of one’s destitute surroundings as social commentary.

Talking Heads,“Once in a Lifetime”,1981,"The narrative arc of Talking Heads’ 14-year career was David Byrne’s slow socialization process and gradual coming-to-awareness of his own soul. The story is told most succinctly in Stop Making Sense, as Byrne proceeds from a herky-jerky, Travis Bickle-style alien exploring late-'70s New York in boombox-accompanied opener ""Psycho Killer"" through the concert-ending revelation of ""Take Me to the River"", where his fledgling attempts at rhythm come full-flower into a Memphis-style baptismal rite. Track that trajectory over the band’s discography—one of the most mesmerizing runs in American pop—and Byrne’s narrative blooms into an allegory for the thinking person coming to terms with their body, with ""Once in a Lifetime"" as the climax. The transfixing moment when the Heads' preternatural knack for rhythmic innovation, chant-along lyrics, chin-stroking abstractions, and cultural syntheses combine into a transcendent total, ""Lifetime"" is also the epitome of 1980s art-pop, the song too far ahead of its time to top the charts, but which would rightfully earn its reputation once everyone else caught up.",Stop Making Sense,9,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

However, the song’s most startling quality is not the withering fatalism of Curtis’ lyrics—which address his failing marriage to his wife, Deborah, in discomfiting detail—but the calm, almost contented clarity with which he delivers them. In light of all the torment and anguish he projected throughout Joy Division’s brief lifespan, ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is the closest we ever got to hearing Ian Curtis at peace with himself.",The Dreaming,8,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s

Compassion was in short supply in the Britain of 1985; meanwhile ""Running Up That Hill"" longs to be understood, but to better understand someone else, too, capturing the balancing act in its tussle between atavism and futurism, vulnerability and might, empathy and lust. On 1982's The Dreaming, Bush, self-producing for the first time, used her newly discovered Fairlight to generate a smorgasbord of exotic samples, indicating gazes set down the rabbit hole. Here, the synth is a divining rod, the padded footprints to Stuart Elliott's heartbeat snare, and the effect is epic without employing her regular windy signifiers of scale.

Speaking of lazy, frontman Bernard Sumner admitted to stealing the song’s keyboard pads from Kraftwerk’s ""Uranium"", the arrangement from Klein + MBO’s ""Dirty Talk"", the bassline from Sylvester’s ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", and the driving beat from Donna Summer’s ""Our Love"". To make matters worse, woeful business decisions surrounded the 1983 single. There was graphic designer Peter Saville’s decision to make the die-cut sleeve look like a 5 ¼” floppy disc, which ended up costing so much to manufacture that every copy of ""Blue Monday"" sold was a loss leader for Factory Records. Running at seven-and-a-half minutes, it was also too long for the pop charts.

Off the Wall had sealed Jackson’s solo stardom three years earlier, but it’s music for the end of adolescence rather than the beginning of adulthood. He stumbles over words, trips over his own two feet, floats on the vestiges of disco like he’s drifting through an amusement park lazy river; ""She’s Out of My Life"" is heartbreak as rendered by someone who’s experiencing it for the very first time. Fast forward to 1982: ""Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’"" is paranoid, sharp, angry, and cluttered, and it’s a window into both the righteous martyrdom and broad platitudes Jackson would come to lean on as his career progressed.",Thriller,2,Pitchfork,The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s
Prince and the Revolution,“Purple Rain”,1984,"""Purple Rain"" was released into a climate where Prince was known as an R&B artist but had ideas that expanded on the gospel roots of soul and the flamboyance of synthesizers. And so he wrote a brazen homily for the future of music, using a wistful guitar riff, floor-to-ceiling drums, dulcet swells of string and organ, and an indomitable two-word hook meant to be sung by a chorus, a room, an arena full of people. But it’s the sweltering guitar solo—so good it still moves people to tears—that brought the song into the upper echelon of stadium ballads. Purple Rain, the album and the film, were the magic results of Prince’s limitless imagination and bridged an invisible aural divide, premised on race, that, up until that point, only Michael Jackson had truly managed to transcend.
