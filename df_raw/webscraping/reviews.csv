2015_100,2015,Free,Paul Thompson,"Funk has always concerned itself with liberation, and Dâm-Funk has long been an advocate for funk-as-freedom; he’d like nothing more than to lift your mind, your body, and your soul away from whatever’s holding it down. ""Free"", the closing track of Dâm’s wordless STFU EP, is a luxuriant ride from the boulevard to beyond the stratosphere. Over a bed of head-snap drums, twinkling Casios, and blunted bass, Dâm breezes down the block and off into the unknown. The eight-minute ""Free"" is a masterfully composed track, tidy as a cleanroom and filthy as a Black & Mild-stuffed ashtray, every chiming piano and wriggling keytar hanging, seemingly, in midair. More than that, though, it’s a testament to Dâm’s ability to make the music of the past—the mechanized precision of post-disco R&B and the subwoofer-decimating synths of left-coast g-funk—feel an awful lot like the future. It’s like the man said: Open up your funky mind, and you can fly.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_99,2015,Can't Keep Checking My Phone,Sasha Geffen,"On Multi-Love, Ruban Nielson applied his knack for layered hooks to his own polyamorous entanglement. Multi-Love’s jittery core untangles the anxiety of balancing partners, of unlearning the traditional forms of hetero marriage, and of doing so while that phone in your pocket begs your eyes to stay glued to its screen. ""Can’t Keep Checking My Phone"" rattles with a nu-disco beat, finding its pulse in an octave-hopping bass line. Nielson’s production leaves plenty of open air for his blocky vocal phrasings to occupy as he stacks syllables that mimic a clipped long-distance conversation or shards of SMS swapping. All the while, a pitched-down version of his own voice haunts his words, as guilt and a yearning for freedom orbit each other. If ""Can’t Keep Checking My Phone"" isn’t the first disco slapper about wanting to chuck your iPhone in the nearest harbor, it’s got to be the most unexpectedly tender.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_98,2015,Dope Cloud,Jes Skolnik,"Proof that there’s life in post-punk beyond basic retreads of bands beloved in the 1980s, Detroit’s Protomartyr have restless energy to spare, both in their captivating live performances and their sharply structured songwriting. ""Dope Cloud"", built around propulsive drumming, a rickety and memorable guitar riff, and blown-out choruses, is both an ode to and a warning about escapism as a survival strategy. Vocalist Joe Casey’s perfectly blasé lyrics and delivery remind us that though it may feel good in the short run to plunge headfirst into hedonism, and that feeling good has value, it’s really not much of a lifelong solution to our continual search as a species for meaning and utility in this random and heartless universe.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_97,2015,Young,Mike Powell,"One of the nice parts about getting older is watching younger people discover things that have been second nature to you for years. Among college-aged musicians playing the sort of lunchpail indie pop they were born too late to hear in the '90s, Frankie Cosmos seems like an outlier. Brief, simple, and direct in word but vast in sentiment, her best songs have the stature of haiku—it takes longer to hear them than it does to listen. ""With this I’m scraping by/ I guess it’s cute that I tried,"" she sings on ""Young"", a self-portrait of a wallflower who seems to prefer her parties from a safe distance at the top of the stairs, as gentle as a lullaby and as sharply worded as hardcore. It all comes and goes in two minutes, with a five-second silence in the middle. Because wisdom is nice but time—time is of the essence.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_96,2015,Nelly,Evan Rytlewski,"Defying the conventional wisdom that rappers need to flood the market with as much material as possible in order to stay on the radar, Isaiah Rashad has kept a low profile since releasing his sleeper debut Cilvia Demo in early 2014, limiting his output to just a few guest verses and this very subdued single. ""Nelly"" is Rashad’s down-to-earth answer to every overly enthusiastic song comparing love to a hit single. ""We can’t be no number one,"" he confesses upfront to neighborhood girl who appears to share his lot in life, ""but we can be the jam."" Like most Rashad tracks, it’s dense with autobiographical detail—in just two leisurely verses, he details his modest upbringing, his practical view of romance, and the low ceiling he sees hanging over his career. He can’t promise the world, and he refuses to feed the false hope that he’ll become a star and magically make this poor girl’s problems disappear. The best he can offer is some empathy, and someone to share a blunt and pass the time with. True to his word, ""Nelly"" wasn’t a number one hit—not even close—but it was, in its own understated way, a jam.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_95,2015,The Lavishments of Light Looking,Jonah Bromwich,"After the horror of the November attacks in the French capital, Thundercat released a gorgeous track simply titled ""Paris"". It made its way around the web, and some admirers, in their private moments, griped about the fact that it lasted hardly more than a minute. But Thundercat was involved with another, equally moving track this year with a far more significant runtime: ""The Lavishments of Light Looking"", which was released by the supergroup WOKE (Flying Lotus, two members of Shabazz Palaces, and Thundercat on bass). The track was a paean to open-mindedness, approachable in its phantasmagoric psychedelia even as it preached transcendence through music. Its explicit spirituality was a balm for those aching from a news cycle filled with demagoguery, suspicion, and fear. When artists attempt to be political, the risk is often that of reductionism: politics are easier to translate into a speech than into a song. But with ""Lavishments"", WOKE managed not to evoke the anxieties of the time, but to repel them, appealing instead to a higher sentiment.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_94,2015,XTC,Abigail Garnett,"There are two sides to DJ Koze: the hypnotizing shaman who spins one groove into another with ultimate finesse, and the winking illusionist who laughs at the shaman idea and teases you for your mindless devotion. Viewed alongside the finely tuned whimsy of his excellent DJ-Kicks mix from this year, ""XTC"" is a pretenseless, steady burner. Its lush, trance-inducing atmosphere, detailed with Koze’s typical quirky percussion, makes it one of his most straightforwardly satisfying recent productions. But it's just like Koze not to leave it there: a woman’s voice, ruminating on what ecstasy might provide for someone seeking enlightenment, emerges out of the mix. ""I heard you say once that a lie is sweet in the beginning, and bitter in the end,"" she murmurs. ""Is the drug like the lie, and meditation the truth? Or am I missing something that could really help me?"" It’s a straightforward monologue with ambiguous implications. Is Koze cultivating a lie? Is he trying to reveal the truth? As the track progresses, it gets sharper and toothier, generating more and more friction, until eventually the tidal harmonic washes transition into something jittery and obsessive, like a person compulsively playing with a zipper. The question lingers, a nagging dichotomy that nods towards the self-aware state of electronic music. How long will it be before intellectualism and hedonism collapse back together? Are we missing something that could really help us?",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_93,2015,I Remember,Mark Richardson,"""I Remember"" is a song of betrayal, about how the more we share, the more vulnerable we become. Each line carries a small part of a much larger story, and as fragments of hurt whiz past like spinning knives, it mirrors the process of memory itself. Bully's Alicia Bognanno sings in a melodic scream that any '90s alt-rocker could envy over basic-but-catchy punk chords, and the spaces between her declarations hold even more than the actual words: ""I remember getting too fucked up...I remember showing up at your house....I remember the way your sheets smelt."" That's how our minds work: a picture, a smell, a taste, a box of photos—all become imprinted, the senses bound to feelings that are later assembled into narrative, leading then to the long process of figuring out what it all meant and what happens now.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_92,2015,Break Away,Cameron Cook,"With the mythology built into pop music fandom, it can be easy to fall into a ""born too late"" mindset, where you believe that the music made before your time is somehow more sincere, more real. Obviously, this is bullshit, and every generation has its own version of this FOMO, but sometimes revisiting old sounds yields something so spectacular that the retro-worship urge is irresistible. With Cool Uncle, Grammy-winning R&B producer Jack Splash teamed up with soul singer Bobby Caldwell, who has been quietly releasing records since the late '70s, and hit this precise sweet spot. From the staccato electric piano line, to the swishy cymbals to the background horn section, ""Break Away"" sounds so pointedly retro you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a cut from some obscure compilation of forgotten slow jams. But the presence of Jessie Ware, who owes considerable debt to Caldwell's contemporaries, gives ""Break Away"" an undoubtedly modern flair. While it would have still been a brilliant track sung solo, Ware's butter-smooth vocals not only hold their own against Caldwell's seasoned tenor, but form an ideal partnership. It's a perfect balance of then and now.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_91,2015,How Does It Feel,Jayson Greene,"Kamaiyah is a rapper and singer from Oakland with only a couple of songs to her name, and somehow one of them is already perfect. ""How Does It Feel"" bubbles like the Moët she drinks in the video, a song about the good life from someone who doesn't live it. The music zooms giddily up a West Coast rap highway, touching on electro, G-funk, and the Bay Area sound. Kamaiyah sing-raps about the most American feeling of all: ""I wonder/ How does it feel to be rich?"" It is celebratory, yearning, triumphant, and bottomlessly sad all at once. It will sound as good the day you get fired and get day-drunk at a TGI Fridays as the day you hire a party bus to celebrate your promotion. It is a song about perseverance and hunger, about ambition and appetite, and every other emotion that has kept the flame alive in hip-hop since its inception. Not a bad introduction.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_90,2015,Blasé,Matthew Ramirez,"Despite taking place in Los Angeles, Ty Dolla $ign’s opus Free TC most resembles a Broadway play, complete with a wide-eyed, scene-establishing opener, a Babyface-assisted aria, and a closing song literally titled ""Finale"". The many moving parts hit some kind of crescendo with ""Blasé"", featuring Future and Rae Sremmurd, which loses all context on the radio and in DJ setlists, but even then is perceivable as part of a larger core. The propulsive banger is something of an outlier in Ty’s long, varied discography—he’s never aimed for a radio hit without leaning on West Coast slap, and ""Blasé"" is pure blurry, Atlanta-inspired low end. The hook is all about twisting typical hip-hop boasts into ""who cares?"" declarations—we’re in the club, we’re buying bottles, we’re driving Maseratis, blasé blasé blasé. There’s a slightly menacing tinge in everyone’s voice that makes it seem like this good time might be the last time: ""I ain’t scared to die, on my dead homies"", Ty sings, straining to hit his upper register. Ty Dolla $ign has made a career out of writing about his needs and how they mingle with disposability—toot it and boot it, how many girls can fit in his cabana, these hoes ain’t loyal—and here he sleepily lands on the most raucous song of his career while sounding like a somnambulant party machine, the guy still going well past 2 a.m. on a Wednesday. But what of it?",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_89,2015,My Baby Don’t Understand Me,Evan Rytlewski,"What do you do when you realize you have nothing in common with the person you love, when it suddenly hits you that your entire relationship has been a slow process of growing apart? Is there any going back after a realization like that? Natalie Prass isn’t singing in hypotheticals on the lavishly orchestrated opener to her debut album—she really needs to know, and she’s posing the questions to you directly: ""Where do you go when the only home you know is with a stranger?"". For all the Dusty in Memphis comparisons her album invited, Prass isn’t a belter like Springfield. She’s got a small, pleasant voice, the kind that doesn’t so much sing over other instruments as draw them in, and on ""My Baby Don’t Understand Me"", a magnificent congregation of strings, horns, and woodwinds shows up to console her, to offer hope when she needs it most. Like so many classic soul songs, it starts plaintively then picks itself up, and in the spirit of Gladys Knight, it ends redemptively with that most bittersweet symbol of farewells and fresh starts: a train.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_88,2015,Demon,Sasha Geffen,"Not all great loves make you a better person. Nestled between the party tracks of Shamir’s debut Ratchet is secret weapon ""Demon"", a downturned love song that draws its fire from the underworld. ""I’ve gone and sold my soul/ If I’m a demon, baby, you’re the beast that made me"", Shamir sings over one of Ratchet’s sparser beats, ""Falling from grace, but falling oh so gracefully"". Dressed in sensual tones, ""Demon"" flips the lover-as-savior narrative on its head. Shamir isn’t looking for redemption, or to be ushered out of a past life into a purer one. Love is a means and an end in itself—and if it happens to corrupt you irreversibly along the way, so be it.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_87,2015,Bank Rolls (Remix),Andrew Gaerig,"Regional rap hits often feel casual and lived-in. If Tate Kobang's feathery ""Bank Rolls (Remix)"" feels a little extra so, it's because Baltimore's been inhabiting this beat for more than a decade now: it was sourced from an old Tim Trees track produced by Rod Lee, an artist who knows something about being a local hero. Originally a short freestyle, the lyrics are dotted heavily with neighborhoods and street names, but Kobang abstains from boasts and shit-talking. The general mood is ""I have friends in lots of these places!"", and when Kobang expanded the track upon signing a label deal, the line he spun into a quasi-chorus was, ""I love my city/ Ask about me and I bet they know me."" As baldly personable as Kobang comes off, the star of the track is Lee's beat, a minimal funk oddity that bears the same relationship to, say, the Neptunes' productions as the Ramones do to the Supremes: a stilted, charming facsimile. The watery Rhodes piano lick that accompanies the chorus acts as a sublime counterpoint to the snub-nosed bass bursts. It's a beat that deserved a second life, strong enough not just to hit the same city twice but to propel a favorite son forward.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_86,2015,The Answer,Douglas Wolk,"The first single from Savages' forthcoming album is an exercise in tension-building and suspense—no small feat in the context of a lunging, steel-toe-booted mosh-pit of a song. Gemma Thompson's buzzsaw guitar keeps moving away from its central chord and immediately dodging back to it, with a rhythm that lands just off the beat. (When she finally breaks free of that chord's gravity, more than a minute into the song, it's like a smack to the face.) Thompson, Fay Milton, and Ayse Hassan lock into the song's high-friction riff in a mode that's way too rare these days; for all the comparisons Savages get to late-'70s British post-punk, their rhythm section is closer to the obsessively precise mania of the Jesus Lizard. What, then, is the answer that Jehnny Beth is whooping and snarling about? Love, but not the fuzzy kind. ""The Answer"" is about love as a cruel obligation, as fuel for corrosive jealousy, as the gift other people get that you know would ruin you. ""If you don't love me you don't love anybody"", Beth keeps repeating to someone—or to herself. Whether it's a hope or a fear, it's a desperate one.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_85,2015,To Die in L.A.,Aaron Leitko,"According to singer Jana Hunter, the initial writing sessions for Lower Dens third full-length were not a merry time. ""We hadn’t played together for a while, and we were in a cold, dark space—physically and emotionally,"" she explained earlier this year. Somewhere along the line, the Baltimore-based band realized that it had fallen into a kind of bad-vibe feedback loop. They took a breather and reconvened a month later with a new goal—to avoid writing miserable music while feeling miserable. There’s no telling where ""To Die in L.A."" fell in this process, but I’m guessing it came after the break. The song has many strengths—it's catchy, economical, and perfectly paced. It makes lush and melodic pop seem like a natural extension of Lower Dens’ minimalist aesthetic, rather than a calculated change in scene. It is best, though, in how elegantly it shifts from anxiety to relief. Listening to the first lines, you’d think Hunter had slipped in her pledge toward positive thinking, but when the chorus arrives the music and lyrics align in uplift. It's possible to give the lyrics a darker reading, with the singer confessing a desire to shift positions of advantage (""Time will turn the tide""). But it feels more hopeful than that—an incantation against gloom and a melody you could hold on an indefinite mental loop.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_84,2015,Dimed Out,Ian Cohen,"If you ask their army of devotees why +@ is their life-changing, vital force, it's because no band gives more of itself. This band does not come equipped with brakes, nor does its leader Patrick Stickles. On a 29-song, double concept album, ""Dimed Out"" is the loudest advocate for Stickles’ hyper-driven maximalist ambitions, and it manages a trick we usually associate with hip-hop, not indie rock: Coining new slang and using it as a statement of purpose. Yeah, ""Dimed Out"" probably soundtracked some drinking games this year, but it goes deeper than that: Titus wants to transcend and to take you with them. You can see it in Stickles’ online persona as well, which fosters a cult of personality that can involve starting a one-sided beef with Kendrick Lamar, dominating his own Genius page, and making an overt bid for King of New York. ""Dimed Out"" overdoes it so you don't confuse it with just punk music.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_83,2015,Seeds,Joe Tangari,"Moses Sumney is one of seemingly hundreds of artists to benefit from rapid advances in both the quality and availability of live sampling, looping, and layering technologies. But while his embrace of these devices adds a dimension to his music, there's an earthy richness to his performances that suggests he could go on for hours with nothing but a handful of jazz chords on his guitar and his astonishing voice. That voice is a truly beautiful instrument, whether he’s folding it into pillowy, wordless backing harmonies or using his otherworldly falsetto to put an exclamation point on a verse. He sounds not quite like anyone else, his style a big-armed embrace hugging the expressive jazz of Billie Holiday, Thom Yorke at his most atmospheric, or Antony Hegarty at her most reflective. His guitar here is simple, precise and propulsive, humbly underpinning the haunting drama of the full piece of music, where ghostly choirs swoop in and out, and an icy orchestral blast comes out of nowhere at three minutes to turn the whole thing on its head. Sumney is still at the very beginning of his career, but his utterly singular work so far points to great things ahead.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_82,2015,Ch-Ching,Zoe Camp,"Inspired by New York City, ""Ch-Ching"" marvels with its magnitude: from the trunk-rattling bass and whip-crack snares to the pop and hiss beneath the meandering melody. Like the city itself, the song's every square inch belies tiered, towering architecture. While its sonic immediacy and textural diversity make it a stellar pop song, the primary source of ""Ch-Ching""’s appeal is that it avoids the expected. Listen to the way Caroline Polachek’s willowy soprano shimmies effortlessly among ghostly whistles and hollow whoops, or how the syncopated brass lends the steeled hip-hop framework a bit of antiquated charm. ""Ch-Ching"" is like nothing Chairlift have done before, and is one of the more bombastic and brassy pop singles in recent memory.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_81,2015,That Battle Is Over,Jes Skolnik,"Unsettling in its combination of lyrical bleakness and meditative instrumental beauty, ""That Battle Is Over"" finds Norwegian experimental artist Jenny Hval capturing 2015’s dystopian global political and cultural climate with terrifying accuracy. Late capitalism has devoured much of our free will, rendering individual boycotts and identification with movements toothless: What, then, is the point of struggle? Over droning organ and rhythmic hand drumming, Hval’s bending and swooping internal monologue, forced outward, wrestles with that question from the position that change is still necessary, even if it seems impossible. What has capitalism done to us? How has it eroded our sense of self? Can we still take care of ourselves and one another in such a world, or are we just going through the motions, despite our best intentions? As we sit perched on the edge of a rotting empire, we find resonance even in knowing others are aching the way that we are. Direct but never didactic, Hval cuts to the marrow.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_80,2015,Me U & Hennessy,Minna Zhou,"Dej Loaf came into the year with the kind of cosigns that dreams are made of: Drake on Instagram, a slew of high-profile ""Try Me"" remixes, a slot on Erykah Badu’s year-end tour, a feature with Eminem. In 2015, she followed through, putting out her first studio EP #AndSeeThatsTheThing, while touring on Nicki Minaj’s Pinkprint Tour, after getting a shout-out from Nicki herself at the BET Awards. By contrast, Lil Wayne was dealing with his Cash Money fallout, the indefinite postponement of Tha Carter V, and a slew of disappointing solo releases. Remixing Dej’s ""Me U & Hennessy"" was one of his more successful musical contributions of the year. His involvement brought wider attention to the slow-burning drunk sex jam that had originally appeared sandwiched in the middle of Dej’s Sell Sole mixtape. Yet compared with some of the other sexytime songs Dej put out this year (""Hey There"" ft. Future, ""My Beyoncé"" with Lil Durk, ""Shawty"" ft. Young Thug), there’s something a little less affectionate and starry-eyed about this one. The song slides and grinds by the flicker of a ""couple candles"", and there's an immediacy to Dej's lyrics. But there’s also a more tangible distance between the two, at least for Wayne: ""Girl you don’t love me, you just love my doggy style,"" he drawls. ""I guess chemistry is true, but I don’t know if it’s the Hennessy or you""—a brief thought he quickly eschews for more threesome- and dick-related pastures. Dej for one, per her characteristic, slightly-detached persona, is happy to keep it about the moment.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_79,2015,Twist My Fingaz,Miles Raymer,"In rap’s criminal cosmology, the gangbanger was superseded over a decade ago by the hustler. Gangsta rap’s basic themes of allegiance to an effort far greater than one individual person has been replaced with the coldblooded entrepreneurial mindset of the trap era. Yet over the past couple years, gangsta rap’s been making a stealthy comeback, thanks to efforts by artists as diverse as Freddie Gibbs, Kendrick Lamar, and YG. Following up his DJ Mustard produced debut album, My Krazy Life, the one-off single ""Twist My Fingaz"" reaches back to the mid-'90s for a nasty, funk-fueled beat, as well as lyrics that pair shots at a new generation of studio gangstas with an exuberant evocation of gang’s favorite nonverbal ways of signalling affiliation. Hearing it’s like living in a world where the G-funk era never ended.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_78,2015,Whip It (Remix),Jayson Greene,"Like all the best Migos songs, ""Whip It"" sounds like it is made of pre-chewed gum balls and carcinogens. The beat starts with a dinky piano patch harking back to Master P; it's so dinky that reigning Atlanta Dink-Master Zaytoven might scoff at it. The song is a toy menagerie and iLoveMakonnen is lead toy. He's so sociable he even makes whipping crack sound like a rainy-day project for two (""My friend Makonnen is teaching me how to whip it""). The song is abjectly, joyfully disposable-sounding, but that hook jabs your brain like the upraised staple in the centerfold of a comic book.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_77,2015,Downtown,Brandon Stosuy,"""Downtown"" is, on one level, a song about the good times in a relationship, when things are flush with excitement and discovery and everything seems perfect: ""Nothing you say/ Will ever be wrong/ Cause it just feels good being in your arms."" But the way Devon Welsh sings the words, and the way Matthew Otto's skeletal instrumentation floats around them like a ghost, makes you think that at least some of it can be placed in the past tense. The line, ""There is one thing I’ll do, if it ever goes wrong, I’ll write you into all my songs"" may be the one thing that exists in the present. It’s hard to know for sure, but when a love song comes this close to an elegy, it brings to mind fellow melancholic romantics like Morrissey, Robert Smith, ""God Damn the Sun"" Michael Gira, and Leonard Cohen, which is a good place for Majical Cloudz to be at this point in their career. That it includes some of the best lyrics of the year—""And if suddenly I die/ I hope they will say/ That he was obsessed and it was okay""—shows that Welsh can back up deep sentiments with sharp, smart writing.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_76,2015,Standard,Jes Skolnik,"It takes an immense talent like Brooklyn transplant Lorely Rodriguez, aka Empress Of, to write and produce a catchy, heartfelt pop song about income inequality without it feeling forced, corny, or patronizing. There’s no poor-them charity or Hallmark Channel pathos in the gut-wrenching chorus to ""Standard"", from Rodriguez’s stunning debut album. When ""survival"" means different things to different people across the globe, understanding the material details of others’ lives can be a catalyst for genuine connection. Instead of preaching, Rodriguez’s empathy resonates on a seriously human scale, getting its multilayered pop hooks into our hearts and heads as we nod along.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_75,2015,High by the Beach,Molly Beauchemin,"In 2015 it became clear that Lana Del Rey's aesthetic wasn't just ""a phase,"" and ""High by the Beach"" is a song that only she could have sung. For every trite platitude—""lights, camera, acción""—there's an equal and opposite profundity (""You could be a bad motherfucker/ But that don't make you a man""). While ""Getting high by the beach"" is a vision not totally consistent with the manicured sad-girl aesthetic that has become LDR’s trademark, it's also a vision she executes perfectly—what could've been a painfully-literal complainers' anthem sounds breezy and somehow dignified. It’s moody and literal, sure, but it sounds, for once, like Lana has nothing to prove.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_74,2015,(At Your Best) You Are Love (Aaliyah/The Isley Brothers Cover),Amanda Petrusich,"In 1976, the Isley Brothers wrote and recorded ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" for Harvest for the World, their 14th studio album; by then, the Brothers were a six-piece, ringed with gold medallions and bedecked in full disco-fringe, playing a smoother, slinkier iteration of the galloping rhythm and blues they’d built a career around. Almost two decades later, in 1994, seven years before her death, Aaliyah included a cover of the song on her debut LP, and this year, on what would have been her 36th birthday, Frank Ocean posted a high, spectral version of it—just voice and some wobbly keys—to his personal Tumblr. There might be no greater testament to Ocean’s extraordinary skill as an R&B singer than the way he turns the Isleys’ hokey bromides (""You are a positive, motivating force within my life"") into something fully devastating, a lament that also feels healing, generative, kind. In Ocean’s voice, the song becomes about the futility of trying to understand a partner who’s dragging around a past you can’t begin to unpack, much less comprehend: ""When you feel what you feel, it's hard for me to understand,"" he sings, his voice unraveling a little at the edges. ""So many things have taken place before this love affair began."" Feeling the full weight of history and all the complications it has wrought: There might be no better summation of the last 12 months.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_73,2015,Foreclosures,Jay Balfour,"Rick Ross’s charade has always hinged on regality over reality, but it’s hard to remain stately in a drought. Last year was tough on MMG, and the cracks in the small empire gaped with the release of two full-length duds from label-boss Rozay himself. On his first lead single of 2015, Ross toned it down for the better. He’s realistic and cautionary about the industry—cutting remarks about malicious publishing deals anchor the first verse—and he’s more endearing for it. A subtle, extended 50 Cent diss hits harder than the corny jabs the two usually exchange; sincerity about Meek Mill is more honorable than bawsy rhetoric. At the bottom of it all, as ever, is money, and ""Foreclosures"" is Ross’ believable dark side warning. ""Learn to walk a tightrope/ Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?"" he snarls over a dramatically streamlined J.U.S.T.I.C.E League beat. It’s a delightfully preachy takedown, but before it all starts, Ross admits, ""I see it from both sides, I feel a nigga pain.""",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_72,2015,Ryderz,Jeremy Gordon,"The rider is a mysterious figure. Bob Dylan sang about two of them approaching in the distance with the howling wind. Jim Morrison saw him as a killer in the night, stalking women and children. D.J. Rogers told us to watch out for the riders, too, and his warning became the core of the biggest, most blown-out track on Hudson Mohawke’s first solo album since he made his name with the TNGHT project. ""Ryderz"" begins with a mostly untouched minute of Rogers’ original, and it takes a lot of gall to gank a sample that completely. But when the rat-a-tat 808s and neon synthesizers begin to whizz and bang over Rogers’ lyrics, you remember that subtlety has rarely been the point of Mohawke’s most memorable music. It’s not so much a curated Fourth of July fireworks display as it is a match thrown into a car stuffed with Roman candles. The agitation of the sampled vocals is revealed by the colossal drop, which suggests the best way to heed a warning is not with words but with a show of strength.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_71,2015,The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment,Andrew Gaerig,"Jesus, what an ugly song. The story of a one-night stand in which no one escapes persecution, least of all songwriter/performer/narrator Josh Tillman: He can't get it up and, perhaps more damningly, misidentifies his company's linguistic faux pas as a malapropism. ""The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment"" surpasses the already high levels of cynicism and bitterness that exist in Tillman's second record as Father John Misty, the excellent I Love You, Honeybear. It's essential that bile at this level of toxicity be delivered via song, because if someone just started talking like this you'd stop them short and advise them to take a round off. There's a ton of posing and preening on Honeybear, and even more during Tillman's excellent live show, in which he fully inhabits his arrogant, louche hippie persona. But when I saw him earlier this year, I found myself hoping he wouldn't play ""The Night Josh Tillman…""; Tillman summoning the necessary contempt for the performance seemed like it would kill the party dead. (He never played it.) ""The Night Josh Tillman…"" is fascinating, darkly thrilling, and vicious. It's like a lot of the unattractive things that people do when they're drunk, or high, or lonely, or horny, or some combination. Tillman's retelling walks the same line between dark humor and obscenity.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_70,2015,Dubby,Nate Patrin,"Don't let Danny Brown's overstated rep as a drug-rap hedonist overshadow his essential musicality—the yelping sing-song variation of his flow may have been initially inspired by Adderall, but his Detroit-raised enthusiasm for a wide scope of electronic music propels the way he goes in. The through-line between Detroit ghettotech and Chicago ghetto house means the already-eclectic Brown knows what to do over peak-level juke beats from the immortal team of DJ Spinn and the late DJ Rashad. ""Dubby"" nails the sweet spot between relentless percussion and gliding soul-jazz atmosphere, and with all that lineage to ricochet off, Brown's verses feel as much like a merging of formative interests as it does an opportunity to show off. The graceful rampage of his choppy, on-the-kick delivery (""Idon'tknow'aboutwhereyafrom butthisishow my! hood! work!"") makes the track's aggressive joy breathe deep. Never mind getting high to it—get high from it.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_69,2015,Fourth of July,T. Cole Rachel,"After trying on a variety of different stylistic hats over the past few years—folk troubadour, unwitting historian, electronic dabblist, full-time Christmas caroler—the mercurial Sufjan Stevens got back to his roots with Carrie & Lowell, both literally and figuratively. A meticulous examination of his childhood and the complicated relationship between himself, his stepfather, and late mother, the album delivers the kind of emotional wallop that made his early records such commanding listens. It offers the kind of lyrical directness and emotional candor that, from a lesser artist, could be treacly and precious. In Sufjan’s hands, however, the songs soar, offering a reverie bordering—as so much of his best work does—on the religious. ""Fourth of July"" is the album’s emotional centerpiece, a rumination on his mother’s death that doesn’t flinch when broaching mortality—both hers and ours. ""It was night when you died, my firefly,"" he sings. ""What could I have said to raise you from the dead?/ Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?"" The song itself is a kind of hushed explosion—at once a dialogue between Sufjan and his mother (""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon/ Why do you cry?"" she asks him) and bittersweet examination of how we choose to face our ends. It’s hard to imagine too many artists capable of selling the line ""We’re all gonna die"" and wringing out so many layers of meaning. As the line is repeated—surrounded by hushed piano and a choir of backup voices—it becomes less a nihilist warning or an admission of defeat. It’s a reminder to live, to embrace, to remember, to sing.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_68,2015,Lionsong,T. Cole Rachel,"A nine-song play-by-play of the demise of her relationship with artist Matthew Barney, Vulnicura was one of 2015’s most emotionally rending releases—densely layered, meticulously produced, and as creatively ambitious as anything Björk has ever done (which is no small statement). ""Lionsong"" is not necessarily the most devastating track on the album, but it’s arguably the best. The song documents a painful limbo—the claustrophobia of being held hostage by someone else’s emotions. ""Maybe he will come out of this loving me/ Maybe he won't,"" she sings, as a cauldron of strings, electronic blips, and her own soaring, multi-tracked voice surges around her. The song is less of a plea for love as it is a request for respect. ""I demand clarity,"" she sings, before admitting, ""Somehow I'm not too bothered/ I'd just like to know."" Like the rest of Vulnicura, the song seems to exist in a realm beyond intimacy—the sound of an artist at her most stunningly vulnerable. By so fearlessly and meticulously cataloguing her own emotional anguish, Björk manages a rare trick. She explores one of the most primal and well trod of all human narratives—heartbreak, the collapse of family—and still ends up sounding strangely like the future.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_67,2015,This Could Be Us,Matthew Strauss,"""This Could Be Us"" is the most irresistible track on Rae Sremmurd's relentlessly catchy debut album SremmLife. It's the record's ebullient light amid forceful club-ready bangers. While the Sremm brothers spend much of the album doubling up on the success of 2014 hits ""No Flex Zone"" and ""No Type"" with songs filled with heavy bass, scattered synth, and loudly chanted hooks, ""This Could Be Us"" finds younger brother Swae Lee free to sing his heart out. His high-pitched vocals are endearingly sweet, especially when combined with a consistent ""Chopsticks""-like piano melody and innocent one-liners like, ""I ball like Tracy McGrady."" Further, Rae Sremmurd take an otherwise ironic meme in #ThisCouldBeUsButYouPlayin—useful for scoffing at potential paramours’ lack of interest—and use it with complete sincerity to plea for a second chance at love. Such wide-eyed innocence and giddiness give the track a palpable joy. On tracks like this, Rae Sremmurd successfully turn hip-hop into pop. ""This Could Be Us"" is what happens when they focus hard on just the latter part of the equation.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_66,2015,Dumb,Jonah Bromwich,"R&B’s tradition of tell-off records runs deep. When the genre was last in the spotlight, in the late '90s, we saw some classics of the form, including Destiny’s Child's ""Bills Bills Bills"" and Blu Cantrell’s ""Hit ’Em Up Style (Oops!)"". But those looking for a more contemporary example of the staple should start with the track that kicked off Jazmine Sullivan’s album Reality Show. Sullivan had grown disenchanted with the music industry after slugging it out in the trenches since signing to Jive Records at 15. In 2011, she announced that she would be retiring. ""Dumb"" was a ferocious annunciation of her return to music, its drumline rhythms and foreboding Greek chorus supporting her fierce declaration of superiority over the song’s subject, a man foolish enough to cheat. Sullivan has said that the song wasn’t based on anything that had happened to her, but that she wanted to be sure to do ""a woman’s anthem"" for her first song back. It’s a fitting sentiment for an era where the voices of black women are finding new arenas in which they can be heard, dismissing any and all of those who would deny them that space.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_65,2015,Living My Life,Raymond Cummings,"""Live in the now!"" Garth so famously beseeched Wayne. That’s much easier said than done, particularly from the dark side of 30. Deerhunter attempt to make this bitterest of pills easier to swallow with maximum yacht pop creaminess on ""Living My Life"", a languid grudge match between pure mindfulness and past and future ghosts. If ""will you tell me how to conquer all this fear?"" is a riddle Bradford Cox poses to himself, ""living my life"" is the mantra-like answer he incessantly chants in reply. Couched in a gauzy, anesthetized splash of guitars and electronics, this dilemma achieves the sort of wary, anthemic grandeur we demand of our high-grade rock'n'roll: a sad song that feels happy, or at the very least capably anesthetizing. Yet no matter how many times any of us listen to ""Living My Life"" on repeat, a moment will arrive where headphones or earbuds must be cast aside to confront the very frightening, very tense world beyond ourselves, with all its attendant fear and loathing.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_64,2015,Angels,Ernest Wilkins,"On ""Angels""—the rumored first single from Chance the Rapper’s next mixtape—which debuted on ""Colbert"", Chance addresses the flimsy narrative that he’s the conscious pop star ego to Chief Keef’s guttural id head-on, confidently telling the world, ""Oooh, I might share my next one with Keef/ Got the industry in disbelief/ They be asking for beef."" Take these lyrics to heart: Kill the drill vs. conscious mentality you have about Chicago’s rap scene. Norwegian producer Lido (Halsey, Banks) channels a sunny day driving down Lake Shore Drive with equal parts gospel harmony and kettledrum, while Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment provide a big, cushioned horn section. Not just a feel-good throwaway in a year that needed some sunshine, ""Angels"" also served as a commendable guerilla radio promotion by a local act that barely saw love on the air. The play worked, by the way. You can hear Saba’s flawless ""City so great/ I feel like Alexand'"" hook during morning and afternoon rush now. (It’s important to call this out as a lot of local acts don’t get that shine. If you regularly listen to Chicago radio, you’d think Drake was the one born in Chatham, not Chance.) Be it overhyped controversy over Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq or underhyped controversy over various cover-ups in local government, in 2015 we needed a megaphone reminding the world that these statistics you see on the news are still humans, that good people still live out south in Chicago and that it’s still juking out here. Lucky for us, ""Angels"" had our back.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_63,2015,Shadow,Brian Howe,"After years of searching, Johnny Jewel and his nightbreed cohort have perfected the afterlife love ballad, which means they’ve perfected the Chromatics song. ""Shadow"", a post-disco ""Teen Angel"", slipped out this year while we waited for Jewel to finish tinkering with the perpetually imminent Dear Tommy. We’re still waiting, but judging by this necromantic teen dream, like M83 minus the bombast, it will be worth it. With an immaculately moonlit minimal house setting and a radiant hook worthy of peak Cure, ""Shadow"" is so subtle it blurs out into timeless myth—or maybe it is just a breakup. But the forensic evidence is there. A gleaming knife of guitar is swaddled in black-velvet ambiance like a hidden murder weapon. A couple is driving at night, trying to escape a dead-end town. ""We’re watching all the streetlights fade,"" Ruth Radelet sighs in a silvered voice the size of a drive-in screen, ""and now you’re just a stranger’s dream."" Think about that—streetlights might recede as you drive away, or just wink out, but why would they ""fade""? The verb seems to fatally ricochet back onto the speaker, who must be turning into a ghost to see things that way. Likewise, the amorphous music lingers at a threshold. Precisely where does that haunting stepwise arpeggio, twisting our couple so inexorably toward their fates, overtake that knocking drum, like footsteps approaching down a hallway? Where do the cold vapors trailing from the vocals stop and the warm ones curling off the guitar begin? What’s at the distant end of this purgatorial tunnel of reverb? ""For the last time,"" Radelet sings eight times, as if she knows but isn’t saying.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_62,2015,Sandra's Smile,Renato Pagnani,"""Sandra's Smile"" isn't a protest song as much as a platform for Dev Hynes to grapple with the kaleidoscope of emotions he experienced as a result of the death of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old black woman who was arrested for a minor traffic violation in July only to be found dead in her Waller County jail cell three days later. A haunting, shimmering slice of R&B with a beat that eerily recalls a beating heart, the track captures a remarkable range of emotions in just over three minutes: exhaustion, confusion, anger, deep-rooted fear, all buoyed by a hopefulness that cannot be extinguished. ""Sandra's Smile"" refuses to admit defeat, forcing us to confront an ugly—and for too many, literally deadly—reality head on without sanitizing its message so that it goes down easier.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_61,2015,G.L.O.S.S. (We're From the Future),Jenn Pelly,"""Singing in G.L.O.S.S. is kind of like getting to be a superhero,"" Sadie Switchblade told Bitch earlier this year. ""Like weaponizing a lifetime of anguish and alienation."" On their demo tape, the Olympia hardcore band burn the no-future scripture of punk history to the ground. Its opening track is pure insurrectionism—Sadie delivers a monologue for her fellow transwomen with a thrilling rage (""we’re fucking future girls, living outside society’s shit!""), before blasting off into a 90-second blur of furious noise. And she makes the group’s total irreverence unmistakably clear: ""The straight boy canon is a royal bore,"" she shouts, emptying her lungs with soul-cleansing gale-force. It’s a tough-as-hell mission statement from the most necessary hardcore band of 2015.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_60,2015,Annie,Andy Beta,"Alan Palomo, one of the earliest and strongest voices of chillwave, released two Day-Glo bright albums before vanishing from sight for four long years. In the meantime, his peers moved on to fuzz-rock (Toro y Moi), garage rock (Ariel Pink), and screwed-down strangeness (James Ferraro). When Neon Indian broke his sabbatical this summer with ""Annie"", he doubled down on his '80s obsession. But instead of returning to chillwave’s vision of warped VHS tapes and MTV memories, now Palomo immersed himself in the decade’s songcraft, from its biggest freaks (Prince) to its one-hit blips (Matthew Wilder). ""Annie"" is the best Balearic song of the year, the sort of silken, breezy, featherweight faux-reggae, faux-tropical pop synthesis that acts like Scritti Politti and Duran Duran confected for play on la isla bonita. It sounds sterling in the present even as it inhabits a bygone time where there were such things as ""answering machines.""",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_59,2015,Hell You Talmbout,Nate Patrin,"The Electric Lady bonus cut ""Hell You Talmbout"" was already eye-opening in its original form, evoking claustrophobia in a wide-open space as its street-crime snapshots intruded on lives spent trying to be lived. But after the events of the past couple of years, Monáe tore every allusive word out of the original and brought her crew in to replace them with a cry of rage and a seemingly endless roll call. The names in themselves speak volumes: there are the familiar ones that brought the Black Lives Matter movement into the fore (Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown), the ones less instantly recognizable but no less demanding of justice (Tommy Yancy, Jerame Reid, Philip White), and the ones who evoke not-so-distant memories of cases that turned a national spotlight on trigger-happy police (Amadou Diallo and Sean Bell). As a musical performance it all cuts to the essence, riding off rolling-thunder drumline momentum and a church mourner's chorus, a marcher's anthem that keeps its structure simple and strong enough to carry the burden of all those names. It's what happens when the demands for recognition that ""I Am—Somebody"" are ignored by the people with your life in their hands, beats for the streets when the streets are taken over by the people.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_58,2015,Fight (Nymphs IV),Sasha Geffen,"Nicolas Jaar leaked music slowly this year. Outside of his unofficial Soviet movie OST Pomegranates, his only 2015 releases came in the form of Nymphs, a series of three new singles released periodically from summer through fall. Capping off the chain is the standalone ""Fight"", an eight-and-a-half minute exercise in snaking beatwork and destabilized melody. Jaar slices up his voice and tosses the resulting syllables into the fray, grinding his upper register in the nervous machinery. The track doesn’t follow lyrics so much as it lets phrases glance off its central apparatus like pixels of light off a disco ball. ""So don’t you fight,"" Jaar insists at the dissolving finish. ""Fight"" takes an explicit look at the workings of the human body, how they connect and disconnect from the sounds they process. Jaar finds sympathy with the body’s quieter experiences, the ticks and hums that move in the background of our inner lives, and Nymphs as a sequence not only echoes those movements but extrapolates on them. Here’s a producer who’s always been as interested in the murk beneath the surface of his work as the surface itself; on ""Fight"", he finds plenty of glitter in both.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_57,2015,Dream Lover,Laura Snapes,"""Dream Lover""’s unruly saxophones squeal a filthy poem of irresponsible adventure and unlikely romance. It sounds exhausted, and liable to collapse—as if Dan Bejar were acquiescing to just one last romp before seriousness sets in. ""I think I used to be more fun,"" he admits. As much as the 43-year-old Canadian tries to act the Scrooge of indie rock, even he can't completely negate the joy in his own music. It was recorded with the studio doors flung wide, horns squalling at full blast, and made it onto Poison Season in spite of the inherent pop DNA that Bejar found so aberrant.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_56,2015,Grief,Andrew Nosnitsky,"Earl Sweatshirt is good at writing about anxiety, and writing about anxiety is difficult. Perhaps the only thing more difficult than writing about anxiety is writing about good writing about anxiety. And when you live with anxiety you tend to cherish the rare art that manages to hit such a high level of simplicity as to relieve it. So why shake that all up and start over again by trying to break down ""Grief"" for you? Wouldn't retracing his ""I just want my time and my mind intact"" a few dozen times consecutively in a Jack Torrance style do more justice to this work than any amount of half-baked word goop about how well Earl distills the boom bap nihilism of Mobb Deep into Tumblr generation numbness or whatever? I mean let's be real—you are not going to read anything as beautiful, calming, or complete as even the shallowest bar on this song anywhere on the Internet today or tomorrow or next year. So go outside and like shit already. Earl did that so we don't have to go through that.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_55,2015,Inhale Exhale,Paul Thompson,"With ""Inhale Exhale"", London upstart Nao—Caracal scene-stealer, ex-Jarvis Cocker backup singer, and possibly-maybe foil for international man of mystery Jai Paul and his brother A.K.—offers up a smash-that-wasn’t, a rippling bundle of nerves in the guise of a brilliantly ambiguous pop song. Through a stream of scattered imagery—rivers, oceans, churches in the wild—""Inhale"" finds Nao cataloging her demons over what sounds like a spaceship gaining sentience; ""it’s me,"" she insists a little past the halfway mark, ""it’s not you,"" marking what may be the first time in history that particular kiss-off is delivered in earnest.

2015_54,2015,Oui,Eric Torres,"""Oui"" is easily the least debauched song on Jeremih’s shamelessly pleasure-seeking third LP Late Nights, and it’s all the better for it. Taking a page from The-Dream’s catalog of similarly lovelorn R&B stunners, ""Oui"" is like a shot of warm sunlight in Late Nights’ nocturnal glow, a heart-in-your-throat, no-frills love song that breaks devotion down to its simplest terms (""There’s no oui without you and I""). That clever sweetness paid off in a big way, making for an instantly likable comeback single. Jeremih saves his best trick for last, when the beat falls away on the bridge to make room for a vocal riff on Shai’s 1992 hit ""If I Ever Fall in Love"". With ""Oui"", Jeremih made it stunningly clear—there’s no other R&B lothario we’d rather spend time with.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_53,2015,4 Degrees,Abigail Garnett,"The discussion around climate change is among the grand farces of our age, pitting the endless labor of scientists and activists against a general state of political inaction and conciliatory half-measures from powerful nations. ""4 Degrees"", the first song released from ANOHNI’s upcoming HOPELESSNESS, for which the singer formerly known as Antony collaborated with producers Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never, cuts to the quick of the issue with a disturbing ferocity. An apocalyptic vision of extinction, it equates a central shrug of indifference (""It’s only 4 degrees"") with purposeful, systematic violence, turning it into a death wish for all life on Earth. Curling out of a steadily intensifying boil of drums and orchestration, ANOHNI’s distinctive vibrato becomes a violent oscillation, the voice of an avenging angel bent on punishing the innocent. A catalog of dying animals calls to mind an anti-Noah’s Ark narrative, the enlightened human willing each one in turn to its death. Even more powerfully, the song coincides with ANOHNI’s own decision to leave the name Antony behind and release music under the name she uses personally. How much courage and how much anger does it take to make such a brutal statement alongside your own professional reinvention? J. Ralph, the composer who worked with ANOHNI for the music in the documentary Racing Extinction, recently commented on the idea of mass extinctions whittling the world’s sounds down to a single voice. ""4 Degrees"" is the prelude to that moment, a savage stirring of frustration and catharsis run through with bitterness.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_52,2015,in time,Sheldon Pearce,"Few modern artists communicate longing as well as FKA twigs does, and on ""in time"", she nestles snugly into the idea of a future that may never come. Over pinched but percolating synths, she pines for the familiarity she and her lover knew before they slowly became estranged. She illustrates this disconnect in the little asides: ""In time, your hands on my body will resonate through me/ Like they did before."" It's a half-hearted attempt to convince herself things will get better or that they even can. ""in time"" is one of the most sumptuous moments on the singer-producer's EP, M3LL155X, a stunning audiovisual experience that encapsulates her strengths as an artists and auteur. twigs and co-producer Tic crank out a production that clicks and bumps in bursts, creating the little pockets though which her muted voice breathes. ""in time"" is the centerpiece that anchors the project, rounding out her previously shapeless and wispy soundscapes into something more solid and whole.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_51,2015,Blackstar,Jason Heller,"As a boy, David Robert Jones loved a book called Starman Jones by science fiction icon Robert Heinlein. It helped spark Jones’ fascination with space, one that’s sustained him throughout the decades, long after he changed his named to David Bowie and launched his career in earnest with 1969’s ""Space Oddity"". Bowie’s latest single, ""Blackstar"", is both an extension of that fascination and a reinvention of it. Unlike the relatively restrained astral voyages of ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"" and ""Dancing Out in Space"" from his last album, 2013’s The Next Day, ""Blackstar"" is one of Bowie’s cyclical retreats from rock convention; its 10-minute sprawl is fractured, episodic, and experimental, with a chant of Gregorian proportions bleeding into movements of jazzy syncopation, atmospheric pop, and breathtaking orchestral ecstasy. The overall impression is one of cosmic awe—a filmic immersion in Bowie’s science-fictional universe that doesn’t even need the song’s astounding video to vividly evoke. Bowie’s longtime producer Tony Visconti has admitted that Blackstar, the upcoming album due January 8, was influenced by Kendrick Lamar, and that’s evident in the single’s fluid lushness and elastic dimensionality. Still, there are plenty of clues in ""Blackstar"" that Bowie still genuflects before Scott Walker, from the art-rock gauntness to the cryptic mystique of his refrain, ""I’m a blackstar"". Bowie’s timbre is haunting and stentorian, and that enormity is driven home by the scope of his vision: Steeped in pomp, space, and myth, ""Blackstar"" not only rekindles his conceptual fire, it reestablishes his nomadic orbit around science fiction.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_50,2015,Pretty Pimpin,Grayson Haver Currin,"Kurt Vile is the pied piper of easy vibes and carefree contentment. His voice is a graceful, assured mumble, and his songs take their time to make their points, suggesting that the singer rushes to do little but relax. Sometimes, though, even bros get the blues. During ""Pretty Pimpin"", the anthem of and thesis for the anxiety-tinged b’lieve i’m goin’ down…, Vile awakes to a state of ""Once in a Lifetime"" confusion. He’s caught off guard by the face staring back from the mirror and the circumstances that brought him to this moment, as he brushes his teeth and considers (at least briefly) combing his cascade of curls back, like an adult working a normal 9-to-5. ""Who’s that stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"" he quips. Even though slightly out of his mind, Vile sidesteps his worries long enough for a sly smile, realizing that, in spite of onset of middle-aged responsibility, the man in the mirror remains ""pretty pimpin.""",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_49,2015,Sparks,Philip Sherburne,"Dissonance and distortion have never played a big role in Beach House's music. For all their pervasive melancholy, they tend to keep their harmonies consonant and their signal clean. But both qualities creep into ""Sparks"", a song whose very name implies friction. The gleaming guitar lead is caked in fuzz, the looped vocal that runs beneath is encrusted with static. But it's the organs that really buzz, throwing off harmonics like a sharpening wheel tosses tiny points of light, in a steady cycle of tension and release, tension and release. It's not all so rough—Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally singing in unison is as smooth as the onset of night, and the whole song radiates a hush reminiscent of Yo La Tengo's nocturnal And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. The lyrics suggest a hazy vision of homecoming and all the bittersweet emotions that come with it. ""And then it's dark again/ Just like a spark,"" they sing, in a twist that is subtle but significant: treating sparks not as a symbol of light, but its opposite. Everything fades to black eventually, just some things quicker than others.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_48,2015,Rewind,Eric Torres,"Where 2013’s Cut 4 Me showed off Kelela’s dexterity with languorous, metallic club music and R&B, on ""Rewind"" she increased the pace to a well-suited sprint. A standout from this fall’s Hallucinogen EP, ""Rewind"" uses heavy, So So Def-nodding bass and lazy keys to speak to that singular, spark of a moment when you connect with another person, drawing on ""the narcotic that is loving someone,"" as she explained. ""It makes you feel drained, it’s in your body and it affects you so completely."" It’s fitting, then, that ""Rewind"" is so utterly catchy, with a spacious, lean bounce to it that lends itself exceptionally well to dance (see: the runway models who memorably broke out into elaborate choreography during the song at an Opening Ceremony fashion show this fall). The song’s ecstatic pulse and Kelela’s airy, polished vocals are enough to make you as lightheaded and in love as the song’s dizzying subject.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_47,2015,Genocide,David Drake,"Dem Jointz get the production credit for ""Genocide"", but it's tough to listen without hearing Dr. Dre's fingerprints on the brash, frequency-hogging mix. Blame it (or celebrate it) for chasing older ears, this brittleness demands attention from the motorcycle-revving opening seconds. While Dre brags about loading up Pro Tools over a loping groove, the song opens up like a trap door beneath the listeners' feet. Candice Pillay's patois leads into Floetry's Marsha Ambrosius, singing a hook that would have fit a No Limit CD two decades earlier. Neo soul and gangster rap, past and present, murder and mass killings, a tree and its forest: ""Genocide"" suggests a multitude of perspectives vying for dominance, and an uncertain verdict. The album's heart pumps with the charged energy of a younger artist throughout—weariness seems anathema to Dr. Dre. Yet Compton was a definitive product of 2015, its age showing in the colliding visions of its collaborators, with only Dre's unifying sensibility holding everything together. His weather-damaged vocals color the record with the desperation of a race against time. Yet despite some fraying around the edges, he remains bellicose and confrontational. His chest-beating verse clears the way for Kendrick Lamar, who leads the song to its darkened exit: ""Fuck your hope.""",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_46,2015,Sticky Drama,Seth Colter Walls,"For his latest album as Oneohtrix Point Never, Daniel Lopatin has created a rich (if opaque) narrative about an adolescent alien, a narrative buttressed by digital ephemera outside the album proper. The fake Twitter accounts and rabbit-hole websites that sit outside Garden of Delete’s running time provide an interesting way to ponder the record’s engagement with juvenile dolor, but none of that would have mattered if the music didn’t also communicate Lopatin's themes. Referencing nu-metal riffs, black-metal blast beats, and dance music hooks, ""Sticky Drama"" isn’t just the album’s most immediately arresting cut. It’s also the album’s best advertisement for Lopatin's kitschy evocation of teenage sadness. It helps, too, that the song’s lyrics are rendered fully unintelligible by Lopatin’s filters. Just as with opera, sometimes you don’t need to follow every word, precisely. The range of instrumental color tells you what the singer is feeling—and what the composer thinks about the character’s psychology.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_45,2015,Leaving the City,Jazz Monroe,"During her five years away, Joanna Newsom tied the knot and became a film star; given her knack for turning personal conflicts into wild musical imbroglios, this album could’ve gone anywhere. Divers’ first single, the poetic nonfiction piece ""Sapokonikan"", was reliably ambitious. Drawing parallels between historical, romantic, and cultural forms of erasure, it felt closer in spirit to a Harper’s pitch than any familiar folk idiom. Followup ""Leaving the City"", however, suggested she’d been wrestling with the same shit as many of the rest of us. A reflection on urban aspiration vs. rural modesty, it takes a macabre trip through gold fields where ""the light will seep and the scythe will reap"" towards a remarkable chorus. As a cacophony builds, internal rhymes fidget anxiously down its meter. From the soul-searching emerges a catch-22, that the price we pay for slowing time is an intimate awareness of its passage.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_44,2015,Pedestrian at Best,Jenn Pelly,"This is peak Courtney Barnett: ""I think you’re a joke,"" she incants, kicking out the final couplet of her most genius chorus, ""But I don’t find you very FUU-uuu-UUU-uuu-UUU-uuu-UUU-uuu-NNY!"" Barnett hollers that word for five full seconds—a drawl that’s so monotone and unhinged it’s like she’s finding some power inside her that she never knew was there. It sounds like the kind of confident psychic joyride that introverts typically only have in their own heads, but Barnett projects it to the heavens in one long taunting exhalation—a shy girl’s dream. It’s a testament to Barnett’s considerable talent that the most epic song on her debut LP is also the most fun. The subterranean blues of ""Pedestrian at Best"" are spit too fast for anything like Dylanesque cue cards, but you try and catch them all: ""The rats are back inside my head/ What would Freud have said?"" Barnett speak-sings, and while she sets her stakes high, she is not self-serious, as her conclusion attests: ""I’m a fake! I’m a phoney! I’m awake! I’m alone! I’m homely! I’m a Scorpio!"" If you’re a quiet person with an overactive mind, prone to self-deprecation, you’ll feel seen in Barnett’s music, but ""Pedestrian at Best"" does one better. It offers an invitation to shout it back, to laugh, and maybe, for a second, to even feel cool.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_43,2015,Flex,Evan Rytlewski,"On his breakout single ""Type of Way"", Rich Homie Quan couldn’t suppress the tinge of guilt he felt about his own success. He could sense the jealousy that his car, his watch, and his general good fortune stirred in others, and judging by his remorseful croon it genuinely pained him. Two years later he's over all that. On ""Flex (Ohh Ohh Ohh)"" he flashes not one luxury watch but six of them, relishes his penthouse view, and broadcasts his latest windfall to the world ($100,000 for just two days work, on top of that cold $2 mil he made off a mixtape). If those figures make anybody else in the room feel some type of way, so be it. Over a springy, Mustard-on-Prozac beat from Nitti Beatz and DJ Spinz, Quan hopscotched through the most jovial rap single of the year, and his cheer was infectious. And that’s to say nothing of the video, which spawned one of the year’s most memorable dances, a flamboyant victory strut as slap happy as the song itself.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_42,2015,I Serve the Base,Ernest Wilkins,"If we’re ranking Future personas (and we always should be), the shit-talking ""I do these drugs, they don’t do me"" Straight Outta Zone 6 Future should garner as much hoopla as ""bummed out with love while floating in a sea of codeine"" Future. While the latter brings us some downright scary moments, the former often gives us better music. Take ""I Serve the Base"", a damn near perfect song. As the unofficial intro to DS2, Future uses a beat from Metro Boomin that sounds like Atlanta-by-way-of-Spacely Sprockets to get everyone on the same page, letting you know things are better on his end since the Ciara breakup and subsequent Beast Mode/Monster/56 Nights three-play. ""They tryna take the soul out me/ They tryna take my confidence and they know I'm cocky/ Fuck another interview, I'm done with it/ ...A nigga was depressed/ Now my mind back healthy"" and that it’s back to business as usual.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_41,2015,A New Wave,Hazel Cills,"In 2000, Sleater-Kinney ended their riot-grrrl fatigue anthem ""#1 Must Have"" with a powerful reminder: ""Culture is what we make it, now is the time to invent it."" Fifteen years later and they’re still looking to invent a new kind of culture, except this time the prospect is more hopeful, re-energized on their song ""A New Wave"" as a call to action. ""No outline will ever hold us,"" Carrie Brownstein sings in between playing masterful, howling electric guitar solos. ""It’s not a new wave, it’s just you and me."" This is a rousing song about breaking through the confines of ceilings and ill-fitting labels, the means of destruction being the realization that there’s much more to being than boxes, bodies, or waves. ""I am raw material, make me plastic make me fuel,"" Brownstein sings, every word in strong enunciation. Vague regarding its targets, ""A New Wave"" emerges as a universal song for anyone who wants to exist without outlines, to get to a basic foundation where to measure power is to measure love.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_40,2015,All Day,Craig Jenkins,"There was much talk in the year following Yeezus, as Kanye West campaigned (and succeeded) to needle his way into the mercurial fashion world, of the Chicago hip-hop polymath having lost touch with the pulse of black America in his quest for personal recognition. In his proper return to rapping this year, after the campfire singalongs ""Only One"" and ""FourFiveSeconds"", West made damn sure to snap back hard, reading the riot act to detractors high and low with his most statistically profane performance to date. ""All Day"" is unadulterated swag rap of the grittiest variety, and you can feel in it the percolating frustration of the post-millennial black creative to leverage community cred against success in society proper. It sucks that hip-hop is a world where our freest thinkers have to continuously cycle back and flash their bonafides, but as a poignant reminder that Kanye West is indisputably black and unapologetically Chicago, ""All Day"" stings.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_39,2015,Kill V. Maim,Jenn Pelly,"""Kill V. Maim"" is Art Angels’ most bracing action scene—and, as ever, Claire Boucher plays all the roles. In a sole pre-chorus, over stadium-crushing beats, you can hear a whole lineage of pop defiance: Grimes morphs from a metallic growl à la Onobox to a sly Barbie-via-Nicki hair-flip to a deranged cheerleader taunt (with the particular ear-piercing squeal of Brittany from ""Daria""). At least conceptually, her pivoting vocal escapades recall Kathleen Hanna in Bikini Kill—how Hanna contorted her voice to show that identities are performed (indeed, Art Angels feels like the album that Hanna’s l'écriture féminine Julie Ruin character dreamed of). No one can sing the words ""Italiana mobster looking so precious"" with quite the naturalistic ease of Grimes; still, ""I’m only a man, and I do what I can"" might be her most subversive and quotable couplet ever. ""Kill V. Maim"" is Grimes as pure iconoclast. No one else in pop—mainstream, avant-garde, or otherwise—could do this, and it’s hard to imagine that anyone would even try. Boucher says ""Kill V. Maim""—with its storyline of an unstoppable villain on her worst behavior—was ""written from the perspective of Al Pacino in The Godfather Pt. 2, except he’s a vampire who can switch gender and travel through space."" It’s some kind of a miracle that you could start there and end up with an interstellar banger like this. Even among Art Angels’ raw balladeering and its throat-scraping screams of Pharmakon-calibre, ""Kill V. Maim"" emerges as the record’s daring peak. It’s a hype song for all the kids who almost got beat-up at Homecoming—the sound of a secret pep-rally for the freaks.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_38,2015,Where Are Ü Now,Matthew Schnipper,"In the past, a honey-voiced kid like Justin Bieber would have ruled the Rat Pack, a bad boy belting out unbeatable pablum. Now he’s a weirdo too, at least thanks to Skrillex and Diplo (recording here as Jack Ü). On ""Where Are Ü Now"" he sings like an angel with a voice made of pure sunlight, and then Diplex just kinda screw around with him on their computer, transforming him into the year’s catchiest dolphin for the hook, rewinding him, and all sorts of other kooky shit. Great songs are often made of either beauty or madness, and often we settle for neither. ""Where Are Ü Now"" is both, pushing music forward while keeping it on the straight and narrow with his exceptional skills.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_37,2015,No Sleeep,Andy Beta,"Even if she hadn’t re-emerged with her first studio album in seven years, Janet Jackson was already embodied in R&B’s 2015 landscape—the sound of her work with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis was everywhere. Janet’s defiant spirit echoed in the likes of alt-R&B stars like FKA twigs and Kelela, her coos in more mainstream singers like Tinashe and Jhené Aiko, and in Carly Rae Jepsen’s recent work with another Jam-Lewis acolyte, Dev Hynes. Even the men amalgamating pop, R&B and rock—Miguel, Jason Derulo, and the Weeknd—worshiped at her altar. When Jackson returned with ""No Sleeep"" she embraced her status as elder stateswoman. Rather than bend to the current trends of uptown funk and electronic hybrids (ground she’s already trod in her formidable catalog), she returned with an air of assurance, never needing to rise above the purr of pillow talk to set the mood. Working with Jam & Lewis to conjure this quiet storm, Janet also documented the wee hours of the night. She sings of a time that’s around ""half past five,"" but here it’s a time where touch and feel is the realest of sensations.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_36,2015,Loud Places,Zach Kelly,"It’s hard to find much to complain about in the dazzling slow-motion rave of Jamie xx’s In Colour, especially when it comes to what is possibly the album’s most euphoric highlight, ""Loud Places"". But still, many crowed about how the track, featuring vocals from his xx bandmate Romy Madley-Croft, not only works better as an xx song proper, but is the best xx song released since the trio’s self-titled debut in 2009. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of ""Loud Places"", which doesn’t really belong to any one person or group, Jamie included. Instead, it’s a love letter to both the records that shaped him (it’s built on a generous sample of Idris Muhammad’s joyous 1977 dance-funk track ""Could Heaven Ever Be Like This"") and the people who helped him reach such lofty heights. ""Didn’t I take you to higher places you can’t reach without me?"" Croft sings just before the swelling nu-gospel hook kicks in. The answer is a grateful, emphatic yes.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_35,2015,Energy,Matthew Strauss,"Built primarily with trap snares over a four-note piano line, ""Energy"" is largely without flourish. It also finds Drake at his most dismissive. He's got countless responsibilities and daily frustrations, so instead of fighting back against everyone ""trying to drain [him] of [his] energy,"" he just brushes them off. Why should he concern himself with anyone else when he's the one at the top of the game? ""I got people talkin' down, man, like I give a fuck,"" he raps. And so while he was lyrically cryptic in his past feuds with the likes of Common and Kendrick Lamar, Drake stuck to his ""Energy"" mantra and wasted little time on his beef with Meek Mill—just two quick, successive diss tracks. It's been some time since he's needed the ""sensitive"" angle to find success, and he no longer relies on the myth-building of ""Started From the Bottom"". ""Energy"", with its hater-baiting video, is Drake's standing magnum opus: Complain about him all you want, try to take his crown from him. He'd like to see you try.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_34,2015,Cha Cha,Corban Goble,"Despite how it might look, the nickname D.R.A.M. has nothing to do with ""drama,"" though the Virginia rapper found plenty of that with his deliriously bubbly ""Cha Cha"". D.R.A.M. stands for ""Does Real Ass Music,"" so it follows that ""Cha Cha"" is a real-ass song. Though the original version of ""Cha Cha"" samples some of the illest fire ever recorded, D.R.A.M. maintained the song’s bounding energy in future, royalty-free versions in a way that attracted inevitable attention. To be sure, ""Cha Cha"" is a horndog’s anthem. D.R.A.M., rippling with enthusiasm, is at the bar where Latin girls go, hoping to score with a ""Dominican that resembles Taina."" D.R.A.M.’s equipment is minimal—that looping SNES beat complete with the Mario ""coin"" sound, a little functional Spanish, a fondness for Latin cuisine, a splash of liquid courage—but the appeal is universal. The joy in ""Cha Cha"" will be sensed mañana, and every future mañana.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_33,2015,Tropic of Cancer,Philip Sherburne,"When a parent becomes terminally ill, one of the first things the children may experience is a vertiginous feeling of unreality. Time moves in a different way than you're used to. Things that seemed important a day before become suddenly trivial. The future collapses and rockets ahead simultaneously, like one of Hitchcock's dizzying dolly zooms. For anyone who has been through it, the way Noah Lennox recounts his own family's experience of his late father's cancer will probably feel eerily familiar, from the initial denial—""When they said he's ill/ Laughed it off as if it's no big deal/ What a joke to joke no joke,"" he sings, in a dazed deadpan—to the unexpected forms that acceptance may take. When I met up with Lennox in Lisbon earlier this year, he explained that the song's more cryptic lines (""Sick has to eat well too"") were a way of expressing ""sympathy for disease, trying to forgive disease""—of seeing disease as ""just another thing in the universe that's trying to survive."" It's an unusual perspective, but from the sound of the song, you can tell he's not being ironic: Rarely has Lennox's falsetto sounded more like a choirboy's, and the combination of the ""Last Post"" bugle call that introduces the song and the misty Tchaikovsky harp that comprises its melody perfectly evokes that fragile serenity that comes when the worst is finally over, and there's no longer anything to be afraid of.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_32,2015,Here,Grayson Haver Currin,"Pop hits have the habit of dismissing pessimism and angst as uncomfortable, unsellable emotions—mere hurdles meant to be cleared. It could feel as though, to make it to the top of the charts, you needed to approach PSA levels of positivity, assuring everyone everything will always get better. But what about those who are cool with feeling bummed out and serving as the perennial wallflower? Enter Alessia Cara’s ""Here"", written by the teenager after suffering through a night at an insufferable party full of boys who wouldn’t leave her alone, music she didn’t like, and cliques with which she never even hopes to click. Cara’s lyrics sport the specificity of a diary entry, with in-the-room details making these three minutes vivid. And above a stomping, defiant beat, her voice dips into low, annoyed murmurs and leaps into strident, sure-of-herself commands. Unapologetic but not rude, Cara argues that indifference is OK and that being uncomfortable isn’t unacceptable. She is positive about seeming negative. ""Here"" is an overdue anthem for a choir of universal introverts—happy to be singing in the privacy of their own homes, alone or in intimate, familiar groups.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_31,2015,The Rhythm Changes,Aaron Leitko,"Buried within saxophonist Kamasi Washington’s sprawling three-hour debut album, The Epic, ""The Rhythm Changes"" is a bit of a digression, an island of R&B shuffle in an ocean of blissed-out and ebullient spiritual jazz. Sung by Patrice Quinn, it has the lush arrangement and easy-going feel of a '70s Stevie Wonder tune. It also has the positive message—about the nature of change, about the passing of time. But ""The Rhythm Changes"" does not feel out of place, even when juxtaposed against the record’s screechier extremes. It comes off like a secular prayer, a call-and-response hymn that offers a different path to the transcendent mood that preoccupies the bulk of The Epic. Though Washington and his bandmates spend the middle of the song swapping solos, it’s only in the outro—when the whole ensemble chimes in together, buoyed by a string arrangement and then a choir—that the song reaches its heady, slightly cosmic, culmination.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_30,2015,WTF (Where They From),Jayson Greene,"Sometimes I like to treat myself to a Missy Elliott video mini-marathon. I watch as many clips as I can stand in the middle of my workday before my fidgeting can no longer be contained in an office chair (usually three or four). I was reminded I was overdue for a Missy session the first time I watched the video for ""WTF (Where They From)"", Elliott's first single in years. The first time I watched it, I could feel the grin spread across my face, and then I watched it again. And again. You can measure the success of a Missy Elliott single by the force of its liberating glee, and she was having more fun here, sounding freer and more invincible, than she has since 2007's ""Lose Control"".",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_29,2015,Feel You,Brian Howe,"The music of L.A. art-pop composer Julia Holter usually comes pre-loaded with big ideas that might carbon-date back to Ancient Greece or Jazz Age Paris. But beyond passing thoughts such as ""I should read Colette"" or ""What’s ekstasis again?"", listeners mainly jettison this stuff, like the bundled software you delete from a new laptop to make it yours. What we care about are the wondrous musical forms Holter spies through her erudite keyholes, and she flings the door wide open on ""Feel You"". Though she can’t be pinned to a single cultural register, many of her most striking songs are roughly one part '70s West Coast pop and two parts early music. She flips the ratio on one of the most luminous songs ever set on a rainy day. ""You know I love to run away from the sun,"" Holter sings in a powerful, purposeful flit. There’s something of baroque music in the buzz of a harpsichord and the ingenious chorus, where a thorny scale stands out against the easily resolving chords of the verses, but a pert bubblegum bounce dominates. Though thoughtful and unique, the song is perfectly immediate, and there’s a type of artistic maturity in that simplicity. Music can always borrow gravitas from scholarly footnotes, but here, the Rosetta Stone is Holter herself, though not in a ""confessional"" sense. Rather, she records her direct impressions of an inhabited world, not of her reading. The impetus becomes the sheer capacity of her nimble, emotive voice and the stickiness of her un-automatic melodic choices. A festival parade passes by; the mist is smeared with city lights; someone was wearing a raincoat—these are the kinds of glimpses one actually remembers, outside of the stories constructed in memory, much less narratives polished smooth by antiquity. After all the studious settings, Holter turns out to be her own best subject. You feel her.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_28,2015,Run Away With Me,Jia Tolentino,"In what should have been the lead single for her critically beloved but relatively inert third album E•MO•TION, Carly Rae Jepsen shot another Cupid’s arrow right at her sweet spot of transcendent genericism and got something explosively romantic as a result. ""Run Away With Me"", like Annie’s ""Heartbeat"" or Robyn’s ""Dancing On My Own"", is purified and paradigmatic; Jepsen goes so breathless with longing that the object of her affection begins to seem less like a person and more like pop music proper, its solitary and universal embrace. The track begins with a blistering riff—some bagpipe-cum-saxophone-cum-trumpet monster, woozy with rainbows and a slight kazoo fizz—and then kicks into Jepsen’s babydoll verses, as triplets beat softly underneath. The drums build, fill, metastasize, and by the chorus, ""Run Away With Me"" is racing. It’s a Gravitron of the genre—neon, dizzying, and ruinous, built with factory precision. Embedded deep within the machinery are six Swedish sorcerers pulling the biggest levers in their possession. The track’s centrifugal yearning pins you fully, blasts glitter into the sky.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_27,2015,Them Changes,Evan Minsker,"Throughout 2013’s ""Heartbreaks + Setbacks"", Thundercat surveyed the gradual decline of a relationship. On ""Them Changes"", the bass virtuoso has moved beyond the day-to-day struggle and has fully arrived at devastation. His heart is no longer breaking—it’s gone. ""Nobody move,"" he instructs, ""there’s blood on the floor."" Right at the jump, he instills a sort of crime-scene panic, and soon enough, he sheds some of the hyperbole and gets to the heart of the matter: He’s been dumped and is getting very drunk to dull the pain. His burbling funk jam about feeling debilitated and broken is, ironically, fueled by the same Isley Brothers beat that’s sampled on ""It Was a Good Day"". Such a shitty day needs a banger, and it’s only appropriate that Thundercat’s powerhouse collaborators/besties Flying Lotus and Kamasi Washington come through with contributions. Washington’s wildest solo begins right as the song fades out, and Lotus’ work is largely atmospheric. In its position as the centerpiece of his otherwise sedate mini-album The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam, ""Them Changes"" also serves as the midpoint between Thundercat’s two best overall looks: It’s got emotional turmoil sung in a bruised falsetto, and it’s got expertly performed six-string bass funk. This year, Pharrell pledged his allegiance to Thundercat after hearing ""Them Changes"". ""He is a necessity,"" Pharrell said, and he isn’t wrong.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_26,2015,Eventually,Patric Fallon,"""Eventually""—what a loaded word Kevin Parker used to name the bittersweet ballad at the center of Currents. Likewise, it's a thought you'll find at the crux of pessimists and optimists alike, the hinge of their secret doubts and quiet hopes swaying back and forth as it's pushed along by time. And it's true, only time will tell. To hear Parker sing it himself in all the song's warm technicolor glow, you'd peg him a reformed defeatist, if only because, after all the times he's seen love go south, there's probably nowhere to go but up. It's right there in that heart-wrenching chorus, those two lines delivered in the weightless breakdown of Tame Impala's rockist synth-pop: ""But I know that I'll be happier, and I know you will, too."" Parker can't see the future, but damn if he hasn't been through this before. Why ""Eventually"" stands out among an album of wall to wall masterworks is its apparent duality, the tension of someone wanting to believe what experience plucked from their heart. Sure, the band's crystalline chords shimmer, their slinky bass lines sway, their drums bounce and pop, but you can't escape the trampled empathy in Parker's voice. That dichotomy sets us up for the song's best trick, one second of bated-breath silence after the music swells to the rafters. It's our moment of truth, the hinge on which we can move on from our deep-seated doubts or cling to them like a deflated life raft. ""Eventually"" won't tell us what happens next, but it sure does make the future look bright.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_25,2015,Sugah Daddy,Douglas Wolk,"So this guy shows up all of a sudden, and it's that one guy. Fourteen years ago you thought you had something good going, and all of a sudden he ghosted—stopped returning your calls. Or anyone's. Every so often you heard a rumor about him: he wasn't doing so hot, or he was trying to pull himself back up from not-so-hot. You'd basically given up hope and moved on. And now here he is on your doorstep... and goddamn is he in incredible shape. Kinkier than ever, too. That's how ""Sugah Daddy"" presented D'Angelo at the tail-end of last year. It supercharges its funk by understating it: a clap-slap-snap beat, staccato piano stabs, and a dubbed-out, phased-up horn section, just barely tracing the contours of a groove that swings like hip-bones. Nothing obscures D'Angelo's voice, or rather his voices, as they casually dive and flip between registers, the kind of vocal performance you can't pull off unless you're utterly sure of your power. Every line is either an offhanded aside or rendered in harmonies so tight that no single melody dominates them. There's a bit of Prince in his phrasing, a bit of Funkadelic, and a lot of a knowing smirk—when you lean in to make out what he's singing, that's when he makes his move. ""Sugah Daddy"" plays on the pop history of both of its title's words; its lyric just barely stays on the right side of the line between super-creepy and super-hot. And it's definitely the sexiest song ever to mention a queef.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_24,2015,Cel U Lar Device,Marc Hogan,"By dancing like nobody’s watching in that liminal space between the personal and the universal, Erykah Badu’s ""Cel U Lar Device"" deserved more than its share of any ""smart"" gadget's data plan in 2015. Drake, of course, picked up this game of telephone with his meme-able, undeniable ""Hotline Bling"", which itself reaches back to communal memory via a sparse '70s soul sample that could evoke civil rights protests, radio background music, or Virginia hip-hop up-and-comer D.R.A.M.’s own 2015 hit ""Cha Cha"". And yet OVO Sound's ""Marvins Room"" drunk-dialer can’t help but invest his Proustian mobile-phone reminiscence with ickily in-character, psychosexual condescension. Not his sometime mentor Badu, whose gender-flipping ""Hotline"" rework doesn’t seem overly fussed about her missing caller. The Toronto rapper/singer's successful slickness becomes the Atlanta R&B/hip-hop crossover godhead’s transcendent absurdity, four minutes turn into six-and-a-half, and—as she and co-writer Seven, her son with André 3000, put it here—""such ‘n’ such""; the difference is embodied in plainspoken ""cell phone"" for Badu’s whimsical yet sophisticated ""cellular device."" Since expanded into an entire But You Caint Use My Phone mixtape, ""Cel U Lar Device"" solidified a commercial smash as part of Internet-era folk culture, and confirmed that we’re connected most deeply when we’re casually, cosmically (maybe a little weirdly?) ourselves. Plus, like the Slits’ ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" or Ananda Shankar’s ""Jumpin’ Jack Flash"", you can play it around people who’re sick of the original. When the gong hits, the bass drops out, or the actually hotline-style pre-recorded greeting rings out about DJing a relative's Slip N Slide party, the moment will feel like yours and yours alone.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_23,2015,March Madness,Andrew Nosnitsky,"As all great street rappers do, Future walks the line between hero and villain, and the divide is typically defined by a listener's willingness to fully engage with his work. From a distance, he's an artist who glorifies Xanax binges, but if you let his music engulf your spirit you'll realize that it's about how there's no glory to be found in a Xanax binge because the world is a horrible place and only pain is real. (Fig. 1.) Usually his tales are in the sound itself—he raps in brutalist nursery rhymes that reveal meaning through repetition and over beats that derive their power from the amount of pressure they put on your chest—but ""March Madness"" is the one track in his recent output that explicitly connects his struggle to the struggles of the world around him. ""All these cops shooting niggas—tragic"" is an incomplete thought, like basically every phrase to fall out of Future's mouth this year, but it might just provide a tangible enough source of trauma through which literal-minded listeners can recognize his more abstract cries for help.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_22,2015,Know Yourself,Corban Goble,"It took virtually no time for ""I was running through the six WITH MY WOES!"", from Drake’s ""Know Yourself"", to become pop music’s decodable du jour. Whether you choose to acknowledge Drake’s definition of ""woes""—it’s an acronym for a mantra his crew lives by, working on excellence—or have decided to remain blissfully ignorant in keeping with an entire lane of Internet-y Drake merchandise, it matters not. What matters is that that particular musical moment (about 1:47 in, right when the beat drops) disabused listeners from the notion that this was your run-of-the-mill retail mixtape. In a year splattered with Drake’s agendas—fuck Meek Mill! New Raptors jerseys! I made a mixtape with Future! I can dance!—it’s best to default to one of his older maxims. Once the beat dropped in ""Know Yourself,"" nothing was the same.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_21,2015,The Blacker the Berry,David Turner,"""The biggest hypocrite of 2015"" is the title that Kendrick Lamar gave himself on the opening verse of ""The Blacker the Berry"". That ain’t true. Objectively, subjectively, there are no advanced metrics or corrupted voting committee that would give Lamar that designation. Except that the only person who matters in that assessment is the one with the mouth that declared it true. Lamar is his own harshest critic, and when he closed the song saying ""Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/ When gangbanging made me kill a nigga blacker than me,"" there was rightful questioning of respectability politics. But that reading didn't take into account Lamar’s nuance. The fuller context of To Pimp a Butterfly showed Lamar’s double consciousness tossing and thrashing with every issue: black-on-black violence, systematic racism, the strife of fame, and frustration over none of what’s he’s achieved being able to change all of that. Back in 2011 on ""Ab-Soul's Outro"" he calmly rapped, ""See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers/ ‘Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own."" ""The Blacker the Berry"" showed neither a sell-out nor revolutionary, but freed Lamar to once again wander unmarked trails, looking for guidance.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_20,2015,Trap Queen,Miles Raymer,"In some respects, ""Trap Queen"" is a song that only could have become popular now: It’s a genre-bending collision of styles that worked its way up from an unknown rapper’s SoundCloud to nearly the very top of the Hot 100, and getting millions of unsuspecting pop fans singing along about the process of buying, processing, and selling bulk amounts of cocaine. But in most other ways, it’s really a timeless song. In cascading, melodic waves it replicates the giddy, weightless sensation of falling in love as effectively as anything by the Beach Boys or the Jackson 5, and if you peel away the Jeezy-ish level of technical detail about cooking crack you’re left with same themes of devotion, trust, and domestic eroticism that people have been writing lyrics about for centuries. Fetty’s method of infusing trap with an addictive bubble gum rush proved the validity of this sugary wave of pop-rap, and in coming years we’ll most likely see his formula copied more times than we can count, but what will make ""Trap Queen"" a classic is the way it makes the familiar seem so new, just like any good longterm relationship.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_19,2015,Norf Norf,Evan Rytlewski,"Vince Staples could be one of the great gangsta rappers of his time, if he weren't utterly appalled by the notion of selling inner-city despair as breezy entertainment. ""I'm a gangsta Crip/ Fuck gangsta rap,"" he sneers on ""Norf Norf"", and it's an important distinction. Yes, he spent his youth running with the Crips, and while he doesn't apologize for that, he's not trying to glorify it, either. Staples dedicates much of his bracing debut album Summertime '06 to sucking the glamor out of the gangster fantasy, needling listeners with unceasing descriptions of violence and dehumanization, and refusing to offer a hopeful takeaway. He narrates without editorializing; usually his disdainful voice telegraphs his disgust for him, but on ""Norf Norf"", he relies on another tool to underscore the cruel absurdity of the street life: a seasick Clams Casino beat. A demented drone set to the stalled sputter of a motor that's been gutted for parts, it neutralizes the machismo in Staples' outlaw raps.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_18,2015,Gosh,Mike Powell,"The thing I thought most about while listening to ""Gosh"" wasn’t Special Request or Zomby or any of the other early-'90s rave revivalists you could easily slot the song next to, but Talking Heads’ ""The Big Country"", a ballad by an art-school band about a man who can’t grasp America until he sees it from a plane. Like ""The Big Country"", ""Gosh""—and all of Jamie xx’s In Colour—is a study in perspective: How cars become ants and roads become veins and how things that are very far away can suddenly seem uncannily close. Or like photography, the way taking certain angles on certain objects render those objects abstract, forcing you to see them again for the first time. As ""Gosh"" dilates slowly from close-up to panorama, it’s like that: The farther away we get, the more intimate the picture becomes. Twenty-three years ago the electronic label Warp put out a compilation called Artificial Intelligence, which took dance music out of the clubs and domesticated it for home use. The cover was a drawing of a skinless alien blowing smoke rings from a Barcalounger. Now aliens can take their earbuds on the subway, ""Gosh"" rattling around their heads like an urban lullaby.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_17,2015,REALiTi,Laura Snapes,"Grimes has always treated ""REALiTi"" as a purely practical matter. The song arrived earlier this year in demo form as an apologetic gift to fans: ""poorly recorded in the first place and never meant to be heard by anyone,"" wrote Claire Boucher, ""so it’s a bit of a mess haha."" Recorded during a fairly fruitless period of creative isolation in Squamish, it finds Boucher contemplating the divide between her old life and the one she lives now, with no trace of drama, regret, or ultimatum; that’s just is how it is these days. It's a refreshing enough sentiment, but ""REALiTi""'s transcendent vibe eclipsed its plainspoken origins. As with Julia Holter's Have You in My Wilderness, the links to Boucher's past work are clear, but the composition behind its burbling synths and handclap rhythms feels fathoms deeper. Testament to Boucher’s skill as a producer, that depth isn't a matter of extra reverb, as it might have been on 2012's Visions. When Boucher revamped ""REALiTi"" as a CD- and digital-only Art Angels bonus track, she ditched the blur of the demo in favor of pin-sharp focus that captured its iridescence—the way it glimmers melancholy and euphoric depending on the light. ""REALiTi"" is an aura photo of a perfect pop song, one whose flowing color reveals all Boucher’s unspoken defiance and anxiety in nuance. The more you listen, the more it gives—it’s no surprise to find a seamless 10-hour loop of it on YouTube.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_16,2015,Sunday Candy,Eric Torres,"Chance the Rapper cooked up a star-making campaign this year, and ""Sunday Candy"", off Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment’s Surf, was its warm, gooey center. An impossibly sweet, plainspoken song that compares love to holy bread on Sundays, ""Sunday Candy"" was written for Chance’s grandmother, an unmatched force of positivity in his life growing up in Chicago. That quality alone gives the song an aww-inducing relatability for a lot of us (""you singing too, but your grandma ain’t my grandma!""), but the love that ""Sunday Candy"" describes can be paired with just about anyone, from a crush to a parent to a friend. Surf had no shortage of joyful live instrumentation, but it all comes together best here, with piano, trombones, trumpets, a chorus, and a gorgeous vocal turn from Jamila Woods that makes the song feel like the final, breathtaking moment in a musical (that perfect, Grease-indebted music video certainly helps). ""Sunday Candy"" is uplifting in a way no other song in 2015 could possibly be, a moment of much-needed love and joy from an artist filled to the brim with both.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_15,2015,Hello,Amy Phillips,"Now that 25 is the fastest-selling album in the history of the galaxy and Adele has single-handedly saved the music industry, resurrected the monoculture, and brought about world peace, it’s kinda weird to remember that there was a time when her triumphant return was not a sure thing. Adele’s years away from the spotlight had potentially portended a lengthy (or permanent) retreat from public life. Or, God forbid, a comeback full of happy songs. But the gale-force wind storm whipped up by ""Hello""’s first ""HALLO FROM THE OTHER SIIIIDE"" blew away all that: the high priestess of heartbreak was back, and heartbreakier than ever. ""Hello"" proves that Adele continues to be better than anybody else in current pop music at communicating the misery of lost love. It’s a rock-solid, no-frills torch song that makes absolutely zero concessions to the fact that it was released in 2015. (The sepia-toned video, starring a flip phone and an old-school British telephone box, drove that point home.) It sounds like it could have been written at pretty much any point in history since the days of Alexander Graham Bell. But thank God it came out now, when we needed Adele the most.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_14,2015,Coffee,Brad Nelson,"""I wish I could paint our love,"" Miguel sings at the beginning of ""Coffee"", and the design of the song itself is painterly, a surreal, weightless swirl, like milk blooming through a cup of joe. Miguel wrote a song about love and lust and located all of its tension in a precise image: making coffee for someone else. Of course, he makes this very small, terrestrial image sound like falling through infinite shapeless atmospheres, because, as with 2012's ""Use Me"", Miguel's artistry is in conveying closeness and vulnerability as they actually feel, as ambiguous blurs of pressure and release; because intimacy is about bodies and their positions in space but is also about achieving a kind of bodilessness; because just after waking, reality still contains some of the texture of a dream.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_13,2015,Bitch Better Have My Money,Amanda Petrusich,"If, in 2015, women of a certain age and circumstance find themselves being consistently thwarted by any one behavior, it’s instinctive, nonsensical apologizing. Earlier this year, ""Inside Amy Schumer"" featured a skit—""I’m Sorry""— in which a panel of highly decorated women dependably and repeatedly sorry’d for things that were plainly not their fault: Dude brings you a cup of coffee when you asked for water? Fuck an apology, friend! Thus, when Rihanna released ""Bitch Better Have My Money""—arguably the least apologetic song of the millennium, if not in the whole of recorded music—it felt like a revelation, a corrective, a necessary and instructive text. Rihanna has never been much for equivocating (if she believes ""top"" and ""car"" rhyme, who are we to suggest otherwise?), and her agenda here is straightforward: Pay me what you owe me. Don’t act like you forgot. She flatly delivers her demands over a big, echoing beat; her Barbadian patois imbues the words with an unexpected loveliness. It’s hard to imagine any other contemporary artist delivering these lyrics quite so convincingly, or with such beautiful bile.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_12,2015,Can’t Feel My Face,Jeremy Gordon,"Cocaine. Once again, Abel Tesfaye is talking about cocaine. For years, it’s been easy to knock Tesfaye for the avoidability of his self-inflicted hell. It stands to reason that if one feels bad about taking drugs and having sex, one might simply stop taking drugs and having sex. But there’s a levity to ""Can’t Feel My Face"" absent from the rest of Beauty Behind the Madness. The snappy bass line is excavated from Off the Wall-era Michael; the Jacksonian sweetness of Tesfaye’s voice counterbalances the potential severity of his lyrics. He’s singing about the possibility of overdosing on cocaine and/or his lady love, but he sounds happy about it. He loves it! If it’s a lie, he sold it well enough to become a bonafide pop star for the first time in his career.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_11,2015,Should Have Known Better,Matthew Murphy,"As with the rest of Sufjan Stevens’ masterful Carrie & Lowell, ""Should Have Known Better"" derives much of its force from its harrowing autobiographical account of Stevens’ relationship with his late, troubled mother. (""When I was three, three maybe four, she left us at that video store."") Yet most of the song’s emotion is directed inward, as Stevens’ grief ripples into regret and self-recrimination, with his lyrics illustrating just how difficult it is to write any truly happy sentences that begin with the words ""I should have"".  Before the song draws to a close, however, its singer has internalized enough tough wisdom (""The past is still the past, a bridge to nowhere"") to permit in a glimmer of light, ""My brother had a daughter, the beauty that she brings, illumination,"" granting both song and album a rare moment of peace and the prospect of renewal.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_10,2015,Lift Me Up,Raymond Cummings,"While being black in America has never been easy, being black in America in 2015 is culturally, economically, and politically nightmarish in ways that are nearly existential. It’s often possible to fall into a double-bind of perceived judgments, where others’ seeming disdain becomes a lens through which to view one’s own appearance, speech, mannerisms, even skin tone. The first full song on Summertime '06 confronts this notion head on. ""I’m just a nigga,"" Vince Staples begins, his flow flailing somewhere between swagger and shrug, ""until I fill my pockets/ And then I’m Mister Nigga."" From there, the Long Beach-born MC is off and loping through rhetorical thickets so dank and dense with allusion that true meaning becomes a quest without tangible rewards, and paranoia and reality blur deceptively. Producers DJ Dahi and No I.D. grind together pensive, bleary synthesizer chords so cryptically that the song’s vision of daily life floods with haunted house dread. Yet the throbbing chorus of ""Lift Me Up""—brightening slightly, multiplying Staples into titular echoes—eases this polemic into the realm of uneasy triumph. This isn’t the discernible tenor of Black Lives Matter protests; it’s the bass pulse rumbling inaudibly, just beneath the surface of things.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_9,2015,Depreston,Ryan Dombal,"According to TripAdvisor, there are precisely five ""Things to Do"" in the Melbourne suburb of Preston—and coming in at number two on that list of attractions is…the local library. This is the humdrum setting of ""Depreston"", which finds Courtney Barnett considering a move away from the town’s quaint coffee shops to a place further out, where green space is plentiful. But whereas previous generations found solace in the predictability of tree-lined streets and boxy houses, this 28-year-old can’t help but feel depressed while eyeing the innards of a deceased estate, the ghosts of the past tugging at her in the form of left-behind war photos, sugar cans, and, most pointedly, a handrail in the shower. The house may have been someone’s dream, but not hers. The minor tragedy plays out in Barnett’s calm, scratchy drawl along with a vaguely country-fied guitar and backbeat. ""Depreston"" could not be more low-key if it tried, like an old Jeff Tweedy demo, but this does not make its emotional climax any less devastating. When the hook finally comes around—""If you’ve got a spare half a million/ You could knock it down and start rebuilding""—Barnett’s scattered observations come into focus. This is a song about not being able to own things. About letting go of ancestors’ desires. About the price of denying death. It’s a generational anthem that’s not anthemic at all.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_8,2015,Really Love,Jia Tolentino,"""I don’t know if I trust you, but I really love you,"" whispers a woman credited as just Gina, in Spanish, at the end of the dark, stringed, flamenco swoon that introduces ""Really Love"". Her voice fades like a memory, and a harp from a dream sequence dissolves the scene; the beat and the soft-shoe bass start knocking, and the track—an indelibly cinematic single and instant classic off D’Angelo’s magnificent surprise album—sweeps you off your feet. Written closer to Voodoo’s release than to the Santa-like drop of Black Messiah and leaked in 2007 by Questlove to Triple J, ""Really Love"" feels as worn-in as it does serendipitous. It’s a relationship that’s teased and frustrated over a decade, which rises, in this six-minute rekindling, to the level of the streetlights and stars. For the length of the track, a hundred dusty particulars weave into a fantasia, in which love sounds effortless but tastes hard-won and real. ""I’m not an easy man to overstand,"" sings D’Angelo, who falsetto-croons his affection like he’s cajoling, even apologizing: ""I’m in really love with you."" By the end, your heart has synced up to that lopsided, soft, gilded refrain.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_7,2015,Flesh Without Blood,Amy Phillips,"In the three years since Visions launched her into the upper echelon of indie stardom, Claire Boucher made headlines more as a fashion icon and a lightning rod than as a musician. But any doubts about her skill as a consummate polymath producer were detonated with the release of ""Flesh Without Blood"". A deceptively joyful combination of a hopscotching beat, lilting melody, and Boucher’s featherlight cooing, Art Angels’ lead single is the rare breakup song about a non-romantic relationship. (Grimes says she doesn’t write about love anymore.) Written ""for a former best friend of mine,"" about ""being really disappointed with someone who you really once truly admired,"" ""Flesh Without Blood"" contains some of the most quietly devastating lines of the year: ""I don’t see the light I saw in you before/ ...And now I don't care anymore."" It served as a razor-sharp reminder that Claire Boucher is a musical force to be reckoned with, a woman remaking pop in her own image.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_6,2015,Constantly Hating,Winston Cook-Wilson,"Young Thug released a lot of crucial music in 2015, but few songs make a better case for him as a virtuoso vocal performer than ""Constantly Hating"", the snaking opener from his debut retail release Barter 6. Thug turns a shrinking violet of a beat, from Atlanta's newest master of understatement, Wheezy, into a playground for his wildest improvisations. The song is one continuous zig-zag. He creates extreme dynamics at unexpected junctures, delivering much of the first verse in a facetious stage whisper. Though they build carefully on one another, every sticky phrase sounds like some crooked fractal of the whole, and could be the basis of an entire song for a lesser artist (""I'm a beast, I'm a beast, I'm a mobster,"" ""I let that choppa go blocka blocka, get back son,"" ""I can’t stop stacking fucking figuuures""). Eventually, Birdman drops in like a block of granite. Run another two or three times through ""Constantly Hating"", and every mischievous detail embeds itself into your longterm memory.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_5,2015,Let It Happen,Stuart Berman,"""Let It Happen"" functions as the neon-trimmed, infinity-mirrored portal into Currents, an album that sees Kevin Parker expunge the last vestiges of weed-scented elephantine riffage from Tame Impala’s arsenal in favor of shimmering soft-rock, digi-R&B beats and French house filters. You can hear that process of abandoning past orthodoxies play out in both Parker’s zen-koan lyrics (""Try to get through it/ Try to bounce to it"") and the song’s labyrinthine structure—when the track locks into a looped synth-stutter near the halfway point, it serves as both a nostalgic throwback to the sound of skipping vinyl and a battering ram into a new dimension. And true to the song’s fatalist philosophy, Parker uses the recording console like a Ouija board, sliding in and out of the song’s many sections as if guided by some subconscious, supernatural force. But despite its seven-minute sprawl, ""Let It Happen"" remains a highly intimate, interior experience. This isn’t so much psych rock as psyche rock—the sort of insta-jam that feels like it’s being broadcast to you via telepathy rather than a stadium PA.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_4,2015,King Kunta,David Drake,"To Pimp a Butterfly was rolled out with a feint (""i"") and a pump-fake (an unreleased, untitled record that only appeared live on ""The Colbert Report""), followed by advanced hype from Pharrell, who promised an ""unapologetically black"" and ""AMAZING"" single that might set the world ablaze. In talking up its musicality, Pharrell may have set expectations too far afield for a record more interested in sly cleverness than brash novelty. ""King Kunta"" is less concerned with capital-I Innovation, instead unspooling an interconnected web of references musical and lyrical, historical and emotional. Produced by Terrace Martin and Sounwave, the uptempo, four-on-the-floor breakbeat channels Curtis Mayfield via DJ Quik, its musical touch-points as layered in potential interpretations as the lyrics themselves. Witness the friction of its contradictions: a universally compelling funk groove that's survived generations of barbecues carrying its gravely serious conceit, a reference to the torture of ""Roots""' protagonist. Meanwhile, Kendrick grins knowingly, his bemusement front-and-center while the details shift, oblique one moment and transparent the next, depending on your perspective. In a snap, a private joke becomes pregnant with significance. Just one example: a line about ""sharing bars"" now sounds like prophecy, while reinforcing the song's unspoken promise—to endure in the name of principle.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_3,2015,I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times),Andy Beta,"The first time through Jamie xx’s In Colour, ""I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)"" might scan as the album’s outlier, coming as it does after the dizzying pinnacle of ""Loud Places"". Profane instead of reverent, sun-bright instead of club-dark, drunk instead of ecstatic, ""I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)"" is about getting low instead of climbing high. Built from little more than a snare roll, finger snaps, and chimes, Jamie xx made a breezy pop confection that alights on dancehall, trap, as well as doo-wop without ever settling on any one sound. On top of the beat, Jamie relies on the yipped boasts of Young Thug, the toasts of Popcaan, and deft placement of a sample from a cappella group, the Persuasions. When reached about the news that his old band’s 1972 song had been sampled, Jimmy Hayes of the Persuasions explained the song as a come-on: ""I ain't got no money in my pockets, they don't jingle, but as long as we can get together everything is gonna be alright,"" and Young Thug updates that sentiment, crowing, ""I'ma ride in that pussy like a stroller."" The repeated shout of ""I know"" becomes a protest in its own way, three very different people uniting in defiant belief.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_2,2015,Hotline Bling,Andrew Ryce,"""Hotline Bling"" is the Drake singularity, the moment where he becomes self-aware and he wields his infamy like a weapon. Even the song's rise to fame mirrors the kind of ""Started From the Bottom"" myth Drake loves—it dropped unceremoniously with minimal promotion and gradually became inescapable. And why not? ""Hotline Bling"" took the wispy stale air of sad-drunk, ""Marvins Room"" Drake and suffused it with warm, tropical colors. It’s the perfect thing to soundtrack the end of summer when the sky gets a little pinker and your summer flings come to an end. That ""Hotline Bling"" found such immense popularity illustrated an arguable skill of Drake's to pluck songs from their regional hit purgatory and put his own stamp on them, with the original performer usually left to languish in Drake's shadow. ""Hotline Bling"" is essentially a reworking of D.R.A.M.'s ""Cha Cha"", which is in turn a reworking of Timmy Thomas' ’70s hit ""Why Can't We Live Together""; by autumn, the song slipped out of Drake's control entirely, becoming fodder for jokes, wedding DJ sets, and gimmicky covers and interpretations. Erykah Badu reinvented it with a version almost as good as the original, while Justin Bieber pulled a stunt that required fans to call an actual hotline to hear Bieber croon the song into their earpiece. It wasn't Drake's song anymore—it was everyone's. In typically calculating fashion, Drake absorbed all that attention and then spun it back on the public. Dropping a music video—a vision of Drake pulling awkward shapes against pastel-colored James Turrell walls, purportedly designed to encourage fans to make their own memes and jokes—almost five months after the song first debuted made it an event all over again. Because if there's anything Drake knows, it's that people can't be laughing at you if you're laughing with them. That idea is core to ""Hotline Bling."" That one of the softest Drake tunes ever dominated airwaves in the wake of the Meek Mill beef was the best revenge he could hope for—the words ""you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga"" from ""Back to Back"" became a self-fulfilling prophecy. As huge as its success was, ""Hotline Bling"" still never gave Drake that coveted #1 spot; he was held at bay first by his fellow Canadian the Weeknd, and then by Adele (or maybe it was the fault of his own business decisions). Whatever it was, it hardly mattered, because at that point, ""Hotline Bling"" was barely a song at all anymore. It was one big goofy, self-aware cultural force. And there's nothing that sums up Drake—as shrewd, manipulative, and lovable as he was in 2015—better than that.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2015_1,2015,Alright,Matthew Schnipper,"When To Pimp a Butterfly was released in mid-March, it was not quite a third of the way through what, by any measure, has been a miserable year. The world, and America in particular, and for minorities specifically, has experienced a veritable buffet of social garbage. And it looks like there's a decent chance the same will be true next year, too. Will we be alright, as Kendrick Lamar assures? And who is that ""we""? In the realm of the pop anthem, ""we"" have had a long life. Perhaps it’s the ""we"" who are champions, who will rock you. But more likely it’s the same ""we"" who shall overcome. ""Alright"" spoke to black Americans oppressed and murdered, these days so frequently by those on the government payroll and sworn to protect. ""We hate popo,"" Lamar raps, ""wanna kill us dead in the streets for sure."" It’s a basic sentiment that in this country has become undeniably truer day after day. But after Lamar’s dirge comes the chorus: ""We gon' be alright,"" an ebulliently simple five-syllable refrain, a future-tense assertion of delivery to a better, more peaceful place. In more than one instance, the song’s chorus was chanted at Black Lives Matter protests. It has soundtracked a movement. That's largely due to its holistic sentiment as a siren against innumerable injustices, but it has just as much to do with the fact that it's a great hook on a ferociously catchy song, produced by Sounwave and Pharrell Williams, with marching band propulsion and a jazz band's breezy reeds. On it, Lamar acts as master of ceremonies as much as rapper. He starts the song with an incantation borrowed from Alice Walker: ""All my life I had to fight,"" before detailing a world wracked with addiction, lust, greed, and Satan—basically all the sins and their mayor. Then Pharrell comes in to sweep it all away. ""We gon' be alright!"" That this chorus is so infectious is no accident; it’s sung by the same guy who made ""Happy"". An argument could be made that the track's power is in the hook, the verses superfluous. And that might be true. Surely you can recite the chorus with no knowledge of the song, or even who sings it. Isn't that anonymous accessibility what makes an anthem? In that sense, with ""Alright"" did Kendrick Lamar write something timeless by writing something bigger than himself, something whose jubilant recitation turns us all into the author? That future tense is always coming, and in a sense it already came. In the time since the song was released, there’s been the murder of Freddie Gray, the suicide of Sandra Bland, the recent police cover up in Chicago, the shootings in San Bernardino, in Colorado, massacres in Beirut and Paris. Things, may in fact, be getting worse. Will we be alright? Who knows. But we’ll at least be together.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2015,Pitchfork
2016_100,2016,Kiss,Ryan Dombal,"Lil Peep is not the boy you take home to meet your mother. He may look like a scuzzed-up Justin Bieber but, with his copious face and neck tattoos (including one of Lisa Simpson scorched into his Adam’s apple) and a penchant for lyrics about cocaine and suicide, he makes Justin Bieber look like a picture of pure innocence. The 20-year-old Long Island native is a devotee of both trap wildman Waka Flocka Flame and emo heroes My Chemical Romance, and he’s racked up millions of SoundCloud plays as an unholy combination of the two. His best song so far, “Kiss,” is a power ballad at its core—but you’ve never heard a power ballad quite like this. Peep sounds like a zombie version of the late Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley as he explores newfound vulnerabilities (“Nobody knows the me that you do”), takes solace in his outsider status (“I’m a freak/That’s why nobody’s friends with me”), and offers some semi-sweet nothings (“I think of you on blow”). A woozy mix of trap hits, tinny guitar strums, and sleigh bells(!) set an ominous tone, but just then, as the song seems destined to fade out, Peep’s voice rings out from the bleakness, begging for one more chance. Give it to him.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_99,2016,Welcome to Earth (Pollywog),Matthew Strauss,"The opening track to Sturgill Simpson’s ambitious third LP begins grandly, as Simpson intones, “Hello, my son, welcome to Earth” with the solemnity of a bible reading. He then establishes the record’s themes of fatherhood, love, and selflessness in the beginning of this lovely ballad. But it’s at the 2:43 mark that “Welcome to Earth (Pollywog)” astonishes by breaking out into a wholehearted, exciting honky-tonk jam. Simpson, meanwhile, shifts his tone and sings about the regret he feels, having to tour during the most precious moments of his newborn son’s life. Warmth emanates from Simpson’s greatest point of vulnerability: When lamenting missing his son, the entire thing explodes with love and joy. On an album of universal themes, “Welcome to Earth” is defining and contagious.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_98,2016,Deadbeat Protest,Jenn Pelly,"“Poetry is my hardcore,” the artist Camae Ayewa, aka Moor Mother, told Pitchfork this summer. “Deadbeat Protest,” from her astounding debut album Fetish Bones, is both at once: an 83-second industrial-noise rap with the all-caps ferocity of Death Grips, but irreducible, more explicitly political, more necessary. “I'm in line at the soup kitchen,” she spits with a low, cooly unspooling monotony, as if threading lyrics to hold together a great tapestry of reality. “These pigs wanna blow my mind/These people wanna stop my grind.” The grating abrasion of “Deadbeat Protest” drones on, as Ayewa’s concrete-hard flow curlicues over it. She grunts and roars, shreds her voice, bends it like rubber. It’s a picture of American upheaval, and it seethes, all energy barreling into the future without permission.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_97,2016,Randomness,Saby Reyes-Kulkarni,"You might expect a conservatory-trained composer to lack fluency when it comes to electronic music, but Olga Bell makes herself right at home on the dance floor with “Randomness.” Kinetic and catchy, it's among the most straightforwardly clubby tracks on her third album, Tempo, and demonstrates Bell’s ability to flow between dance, R&B, hip-hop, and experimental modes. In fact, you’d never guess that Bell hasn’t spent her entire career as an electronic producer, or that her last record was a Russian-language folk song cycle. Bell may have set out to use overtly commercial (and even “almost kind of gross”) sounds, but the sheer exuberance of “Randomness” overrides her use of dance music’s most familiar hallmarks. The thumping beat and frosty synthesizer hook are about as true to convention as they come, but Bell brings a distinct spark of personality, her vocals landing with a slight sting. If you’ve never had the pleasure of mouthing the words, “You've got that shit eating grin when there’s nobody smilin’” while going full-tilt in a crush of moving bodies, here's your chance.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_96,2016,Vibin in This Bih,Sam Hockley-Smith,"How is it that Kodak Black—a young Floridian rapper who sounds like a combination of a half-asleep Lil Boosie, a more sing-songy Lil Wayne, and Juvenile minus about two decades of life experience—is able to sound so wise? Part of it is that voice, which manages to croak and float; it doesn’t seem like anyone should be able to do both. The other part is his complete disinterest in being flashy. “Vibin in This Bih” is just two vocabulary-obsessed rappers doing what they do best. Kodak is a vibrant, economical writer: “People rootin’ for the hustler, I think I’m on next/At your neck, I don’t get tired, I ain’t gon’ rest.” His verse is quietly hypnotic, each line its own story, and then Gucci comes in, palpably reveling in his newfound freedom. They’re a great pair, but Kodak carries the track. He may not be asking for our attention, but he’s already earned it.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_95,2016,I’m On,Raymond Cummings,"Doubling as Kamaiyah Johnson’s mission statement and her come-up fiesta, “I’m On” is taut, direct, and throwback hazy. Producer Drew Banga bolsters the 24-year-old Oakland, California MC’s vocals with tambourines and splashy tropical keyboards, recalling late-’80s/early-’90s R&B minimalism. Kamaiyah slides effortlessly from rapping to singing and back, retracing bleak yesterdays and brighter tomorrows with a dispassionate, no-bullshit rasp. “Remember when I didn’t have shoestrings?” she asks. “Now I pull up, hop out, watch that coup swing/Big money, get money, we do things.” As she relates, her rise seems equally incredible and inevitable: Her hard pluck overcame the hardest of luck, steering her from going hungry to scoring features on YG and E-40 tracks. In “I’m On,” Kamaiyah seems unfazed by her burgeoning success, but it’s hard not to celebrate her.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_94,2016,Wonderful,Philip Sherburne,"No song on Cate Le Bon’s Crab Day better exemplifies the album’s curious balance of sweetness and dissonance than “Wonderful,” a song whose seemingly chipper refrain—“Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful”—belies its anxious, caustic mood. Atonal guitar figures skitter like spiders across pumping barroom piano, marimba flourishes, and sour bursts of throaty saxophone skronk. The net effect suggests a fender-bender between the Slits and the Velvet Underground, with Raymond Scott as the lone eyewitness. As usual, “cryptic” barely begins to describe the Welsh singer-songwriter’s approach to narrative; if you’ve ever repeated a word to yourself until all meaning leached out of its suddenly alien contours, her verses here will have a certain uncanny familiarity. Ultimately, the song adds up to a kind of giddy riddle with an answer only Le Bon knows. But whatever she may mean by the declaration, “I wanna be a ten-pin ball,” knocking down the pieces and picking them up again proves endlessly fascinating.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_93,2016,When It Rain,Sheldon Pearce,"In inner cities, the saying “when it rains, it pours” often correlates to gunshots. This is especially true in Danny Brown’s hometown. Violent crimes were down 13% in Detroit last year and still, the city still only finished behind St. Louis in murder rates. Brown’s “When It Rain” is a careful taxonomy of Detroit criminology that identifies the many types of gunmen in the so-called City of Boom, what drives them (poverty, mostly, but sometimes greed), and how locals, including Brown himself, try to escape from death’s grasp. His flow is skittering and his vocals bend out of shape into his signature squeal. The way he cuts perspectives together is jolting; he relates with both the shooters and the victims, the jailed and the free. Over a collage of percussive sound that rumbles with a thunderous boom, he is strikingly eloquent: “Dark clouds hanging all over our head/No sunshine and them showers be lead.”",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_92,2016,Can't Stop Fighting,Evan Minsker,"Sheer Mag’s “Can’t Stop Fighting” is another entry in their ironclad canon of classic, beefy rock’n’roll. Kyle Seely’s guitar sound is still enormous and catchy; Tina Halladay still comes through with a dominant growl. They make adrenaline-filled guitar music, which is good, because the narrative here starts out rough: The song opens with a scene from the femicide in Ciudad Juárez. One minute, a woman is walking home after a late shift at the maquiladora. Eight days later, she’s still missing. “We can’t stop fighting, we can’t stop fighting,” sings Halladay. It’s a grisly narrative—one that likely has more in common with Roberto Bolaño’s 2666 than the Philly band’s day-to-day reality. By the end of the song, it’s a battle cry to fight palpable enemies—both the neighborhood assholes and the so-called “friends” who refuse to empathize. Sheer Mag are mad as hell, they’re not going to take it anymore, and they've got hooks.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_91,2016,No Heart,Matthew Ramirez,"Tellingly credited to 21 Savage and his producer Metro Boomin, the Atlanta rapper’s deliberate, chilling summertime EP Savage Mode worked a few notes (icy synths, ominous low-end, spoken-word delivery) into a fully crystallized aesthetic. “No Heart,” a song that could be summed up as Fredo Santana meets the xx, is the record’s highlight. 21 Savage’s autobiographical imagery could be dismissed as horrorcore but his delivery makes it work as he subtly alters his flow with each verse, signaling a different train of thought. In the end, the song becomes less about its shock value and more about how 21 Savage tells this story—it’s a treatise on the GBE-meets-Ka aesthetic, a wisp of a banger confident in both its content and how it presents its story.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_90,2016,Old Friends,Ian Cohen,"Pinegrove’s 2015 compilation Everything So Far began with Evan Hall singing, “I resolve to make new friends/I like my old ones but I fucked up so I’ll start again.” It was boisterous and optimistic and rightfully so; making new friends in one’s twenties can be simply a matter of resolve. But it gets harder with every year into adulthood, and this past February, the British Journal of Psychology and Pinegrove’s “Old Friends” came to the same conclusion as to why that is: Intelligent people become too goal-oriented and less vulnerable or, as Hall puts it, “Too caught up in my own shit/That’s how every outcome’s such a comedown.” “Old Friends” finds Hall in one of his solipsistic moods, making hyper-detailed observations of his surroundings yet feeling disconnected from the people closest to him. “I should call my parents when I think of them/Should tell my friends when I love them,” he sighs, the should making it unclear whether he’s had an epiphany or just another clever thought that will come and go like a joke about the Port Authority. Even as the economic and romantic anxieties of millennials continue to be exhaustively documented, “Old Friends” feels like a fresh take—maybe making new friends isn't as important as keeping the old ones.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_89,2016,On the Lips,Marc Hogan,"Greta Kline, aka Frankie Cosmos, has a gift for songs that are demonstrably grounded in real life, with arrangements anyone could play, but which still seem like miniature epiphanies. Next Thing highlight “On the Lips” has all the trappings of quintessential indie-pop: keenly observational lyrics, sprightly guitar strums, and a wistful chorus about a kiss that never happens. But Kline packs so much into the track’s sub-two-minutes: musings about watching David Blaine, a curious lyrical aside that gave the title to Cosmos’s 2013 effort im sorry im hi lets go (where “On the Lips” originally appeared, in rougher form), and an existential question that never gets answered. It’s a song less about kissing than about believing, even at the risk of looking foolish. “I don’t want magic that looks real,” Blaine himself once said. “What I want are real things that feel like magic.” That’s an apt description of what Kline accomplishes here.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_88,2016,Needed Me,Matthew Schnipper,"This year, a photo of Rihanna made the rounds in which she’s wearing super pointy heels, a giant coral jacket that might as well be a sleeping bag, and a T-shirt that reads “YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.” It’s unclear if she’s wearing pants. Seems like a safe bet that’s what she was wearing when she recorded “Needed Me.” Has Rihanna ever delivered a more apt lyric than, “Didn’t they tell you that I was a savage?/Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage”? “Needed Me” may be a steady 110 BPM, but it slinks along like she recorded it in a steam room. Producer DJ Mustard borrows from the UK house tradition of the disembodied voice, and all the cut-up vocals echo like ghosts of the men Rihanna swallowed whole.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_87,2016,In Common,Andy Beta,"If you follow Alicia Keys on Instagram, you already know she’s drawn to Nigerian pop acts like Wizkid and Davido, part of the ascendant Afrobeats sound. Part UK funky, part soca, part dancehall, part soda pop bubble, this Nigerian/Ghanaian hybrid became the sound of the year, so it made sense that Ms. Keys and producer Illangelo wove those vibrant tropical patterns into “In Common.” It’s a rare, welcome instance of Keys moving out of her musical comfort zone and riding the humid groove, and she took it all the way to the DNC stage. It would have been easy enough to pair that genre’s bubbling rhythm with a lyrical bauble, but Keys instead twists the love song trope of “opposites attract.” “If you could love somebody like me/You must be messed up too” simultaneously indicts and embraces the dysfunction, insecurity, and maddening laws of attraction that undergird modern love.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_86,2016,Sunday Love,Amy Phillips,"Bat for Lashes’ The Bride is a concept album about a woman left stranded at the altar when her fiancé is killed in a car crash en route to their wedding. Overdramatic? Yes. Heavy-handed? Sure. But Natasha Khan has always excelled at sweeping up the listener in grand tides of feeling, and the widowed bride’s emotional rollercoaster ride proves to be an ideal vessel for her songs. “Sunday Love” takes place after the bride has raced out of the church, jumped behind the wheel of her car, and sped away to embark on a grief-stricken solo honeymoon. The track’s nervous, pulsing rhythm mimics the paranoia of the lyrics (“I see her in every place I go,” “She's in my bedroom/Now I can't fight”), contrasting with Khan’s lilting vocals and harp melody to conjure a swirling descent into madness. The Bride ends with redemption through self-love, but no story earns its happy ending without a fight. “Sunday Love” is the bottom the bride must hit in order to begin her crawl upwards towards the light.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_85,2016,Sister,Jillian Mapes,"“The thing about getting older is that instead of deciding that you’ve figured it out, you get better at realizing you never will,” Angel Olsen told Pitchfork earlier this year. Olsen reaches a similar conclusion at the end of the ambling journey she takes on “Sister,” the Crazy Horse-flecked centerpiece of her third album, My Woman. “All my life I thought had changed,” she pleads again and again throughout the last half, before an eruption of a solo from guitarist Stewart Bronaugh. Though some may think Olsen is singing about her actual sibling, her inward reflection suggests that the sister is within, the parts of herself that she’s learned to love over time. Like many existential struggles, these are hard-earned realizations, not eureka moments—a fact that’s echoed by the song’s pacing and its video’s loose plotline. Few singer-songwriters could sustain an introspective slow-burn the way Olsen does here, but then again, few singer-songwriters have the lyrical skill and vocal range that she does, either.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_84,2016,Give Violence a Chance,Cameron Cook,"One of the most puzzling reactions to Donald Trump’s election within the music community has been, “Well, at least there’ll be some good punk rock in the next four years.” As if life in America up until this point hadn’t already been vitriolic fodder for anyone on the outskirts—as if punk had always been the realm of straight, white men, sequestered in suburbia, who apparently needed the threat of an orange boogeyman to bang out a record. In reality, this is merely the moment where the true 21st century punks—the black kids, the queer, the transgendered, the anarchists—are put to an even more arduous task than before. “Give Violence a Chance” by G.L.O.S.S. (which stands for “Girls Living Outside Society’s Shit”) may just serve as one of their anthems, a two-minute call-to-arms to cut the kumbaya and start bashing back. Spewed across a booming buzzsaw riff, frontwoman Sadie Switchblade screams with a rage so potent, you could slice through it with a rusty boxcutter. “When peace is just another word for death/It’s our turn to give violence a chance,” she yells, giving life to a scary realization the vulnerable can face when confronted with hate: You better get them before they get you.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_83,2016,Promises of Fertility,Thea Ballard,"Huerco S. once described listening to ambient music as a means of coping with anxiety while traveling; he noted, too, that his own most recent LP, For Those of You Who Have Never (and Also Those Who Have), had a similar calming effect on him. “Promises of Fertility” is the most distilled example of this, a track that stretches and softens the atmospherics that colored in the grainy house music of his earlier work. It’s comprised of a glistening melody that wanders above tape hiss—vaguely reminiscent of hold music, but decelerated to the point that time seems to disintegrate. The track begins and ends in the middle of a note as if, for seven minutes, Huerco is tuning us into a radio frequency that will transmit this loop forever. It’s dreamy but neutral in its expression and, in turn, utterly narcotic.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_82,2016,Into You,Amy Phillips,"For a little while last year, Ariana Grande seemed close to a Bieber/Britney-esque freefall. After the whole donut-licking scandal, the flop of intended comeback single “Focus,” and her breakup with Big Sean, the familiar narrative of child star-turned-sexpot-turned-trainwreck appeared to be playing itself out again. But the release of the mature, self-assured Dangerous Woman, and the various hits it spawned, ended up crushing haters’ doubts under the spike of Ariana's high-heeled go-go boot. “Into You” has haunted pop radio for the past several months, as songs produced by Max Martin tend to do. A throbbing, slow-burning come-on, “Into You” captures the thrill of the moment just before an illicit kiss, when the will-they-or-won’t-they tension becomes almost unbearable. “A little less conversation and a little more touch my body,” she demands, channeling Elvis and Mariah Carey, the progenitor of Grande’s particular strain of vocal bombast. And now we know: Ariana Grande is not going away any time soon.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_81,2016,Golden Chords,Marc Masters,"There’s a beautiful irony in Deakin’s “Golden Chords.” The album it comes from*, Sleep Cycle*, was born from a controversial Kickstarter project long delayed due to Josh Dibb’s creative doubts and “fatal perfectionism.” That delay upset many, but the final music was worth it—not despite the struggle, but because of it. “Golden Chords” is an honest meditation on uncertainty and self-esteem, an attempt to escape artistic paralysis by, as the Animal Collective co-founder sings, “shak[ing] these broken chords till they turn gold.” Dibb gives himself this pep talk using soft acoustic guitar strums, subdued percussion loops, and a whispery falsetto. He opens the song so confused about how to combat his creative funk that every solution feels wrong. Yet small stabs at positivity build up until Dibb sounds nearly restored: “In time/You’ll revive what you thought dead … Stop believing your being’s been shattered and distorted/’Cause, brother, you’re so full of love.” That he’s right makes “Golden Chords” a meta-victory: a song about how strife can lead to triumph that proves its own point.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_80,2016,The Wheel,Evan Minsker,"PJ Harvey’s “The Wheel” is a song haunted by war and human rights atrocities, but it’s no dirge. Everything is handclaps, saxophone, and momentum leading to a call-and-response singalong chorus. “Watch them fade out,” she sings at the end, repeatedly, about the wall of “sun-bleached” photographs of the disappeared. Then, the song itself abruptly fades. Harvey has written about global conflicts before, but “The Wheel,” about the state of Kosovo, could well be her most vibrant attempt—a potent combination of rock’n’roll gusto and stone-faced reporting.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_79,2016,Qwazars,Andrew Gaerig,"“What’s going on? Quasars.” The spacey sample is repeated a handful of times across this slowly evolving six-minute track by Larry Heard, aka Mr. Fingers. He’s engaging in a bit of mystery-building, one that has been central to dance music for decades: Make some common elements—a pulsing synthesizer, some hi-hats and a snare that have been shifted off-axis just so—feel stranger than they really are. Though he’s working with pretty simple stuff, that does not mean what Heard has done here is easy. The opening kick drum and pulse land so softly that “Qwazars” feels like a baby shampoo version of Heard’s rawer work under the Fingers alias 30 years ago. The ringing tones that dot the track are given their star moment in the final minutes. It takes a deft hand to recreate what the future sounded like in the mid ’80s; it takes an old hand to realize that’s what we still want the future to sound like now.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_78,2016,blisters,Philip Sherburne,"The lead song and title track on serpentwithfeet’s debut EP, “blisters” might have been spontaneously produced from the ether, so airy are its harp and strings and so weightless serpentwithfeet’s own falsetto. But it is also a song about suffering, from its title to its sorrowful subject matter, in which unrequited love stands in for a more existential kind of trauma, one connected to ideas about blackness and sexuality and articulated in the heartbreaking refrain, “Forgiveness has not forgiven it.” serpentwithfeet is no stranger to contradictions—his forehead bears tattoos reading “SUICIDE” and “HEAVEN”—and the Haxan Cloak’s production on the song does an admirable job of living up to the singer’s multitudes. The funereal drumbeat’s handclaps sound like splashing water; a lonely clarinet traces a line of flight out of the song’s gridded repetitions. But even these sounds pale next to the vividness of the singer’s own richly imagistic lyrics. In just six carefully chosen words—“Concrete has hurried itself into blue”—serpentwithfeet gives us one of the year’s greatest opening lines, the kind that sinks its hooks into you and refuses to let go.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_77,2016,Man,Thea Ballard,"Skepta’s “Man” lays out some friendly parameters for how not to ingratiate yourself to this Mercury Prize-winning grime icon: Don’t seek attention, don’t tell people you’re his cousin, and, most of all, don’t ask for a pic for the ’gram. Driven by an excellent Queens of the Stone Age sample and ominous, relentless bass, the frenetic track is one of the most concise singles on Konnichiwa. This year has highlighted how audiences expect pop and rap artists to reinvent themselves regularly if they want to hold our attention. However, it’s equally rewarding to hear Skepta refine his voice as he stays loyal not just to his friends and family, but to the sound he’s helped build. Plus, “Man” sneaks in one of the best disses of 2016: “Dressed like I just come from P.E.,” he brags to an interloper. “You’re dressed like you just come from church.”",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_76,2016,30 Keys,Chris Randle,"The Brooklyn rapper Ka likes to keep things economical. His introspective music is self-released and nearly always self-produced. By those standards, “30 Keys” counts as a lavish indulgence: Roc Marciano provided the beat, and you can make out some drums. “In this trade, ain’t afraid to get splashed or busted,” he recalls, slipping the borders between past and present. “Even for small numbers, none are vastly trusted.” His frayed rasp frames crime as an existential act: “I don’t wanna do it, gotta do it.” Ka also directs his own videos, and this one cuts between shots of the MC in sparse rain and scenes from old blaxploitation movies, lingering on incidental details; the opening is somebody loading a DVD for half a minute. Extreme close-ups cut off the top half of Ka’s face. Like much of his work, “30 Keys” uses abstract language to yield bigger truths.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_75,2016,Pick Up the Phone,Paul A. Thompson,"“Pick Up the Phone” is nominally a Travis Scott song, but in nearly every way that matters, it belongs to Young Thug. That’s Thug leaning like grandma, comparing cheating to treason, paying his sisters’ tuition in crumpled fives and 10s. It’s Thug rapping “Mama told me don’t hate on the law/Because everybody got a job/Because everyone wanna be a star,” a tossed-off parable that doubles as a reflection of modern state violence. For him, “Pick Up the Phone” is a tour de force, a reminder that no matter how scattered or inscrutable his solo output becomes, he can cut through the din with a perfect piece of pop. By the time Quavo swoops in to coin the word “discriminize” and say, “I thought I was right/Then I had to man up/I was wrong,” it’s already a wrap.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_74,2016,Somebody Else,Brad Nelson,"The 1975’s “Somebody Else” describes someone caught between the emotional phases one passes through after a breakup, as if stuck between colors in a gradient. It touches on the kind of confused feelings people usually bury for fear of looking like an asshole—but the 1975 frontman Matty Healy isn’t afraid of looking like an asshole. “Somebody Else” embodies this post-breakup ambivalence in both its lyric and its sound—there’s a swerve to the opening synths that makes it seem like they’re evolving from one hue to another, a damp echo to the atmosphere that makes every instrument sound slightly hazy and drunk and too cool for itself. Unlike their previous singles, the band sound like something less defined and more introspective, a position from which they are able to give shape to something vanished. “I don’t want your body/But I hate to think about you with somebody else,” Healy sings, drums pulsing behind him like the vague, sourceless ache of a hangover.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_73,2016,That Part,Evan Rytlewski,"Like a lot of rap pairings, this Schoolboy Q/Kanye West track is less a meeting of minds than a negotiation between agents. Nearly anybody can land nearly any feature for the right price, and at first Kanye almost seems to be mocking the transactional nature of guest verses here, filling an alarming number of bars with the word “OK”—you can almost imagine Schoolboy’s face sinking when he heard it for the first time. It’s a fake-out, though. Soon Kanye is feeding off the energy of his fellow hothead, firing off some of his most memorable zingers of the year (“Rich n*gga, still eatin’ catfish/That bitch ain’t really bad, that’s a catfish”). And in what could be an apology for all those “OKs,” he even throws in a wild, half-improvised walk-off verse where he brags about having Scottie Pippen at his wedding and comes this close to making a Ray J reference but stops short, just to fuck with people. Never let it be said that when you pay for a Kanye verse, you don’t get your money’s worth.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_72,2016,Lonely World,Noah Yoo,"There are two sides to Moses Sumney as we understand him now. The first is the solo live performer, a powerful presence that constructs sonic journeys onstage using only his voice, his hands, a guitar, and some loopers. The second is the recording artist, a more reclusive specter that has just begun to take shape in the world’s eye. After channeling Nina Simone’s pained timbre in the verses, Sumney slowly reveals “Lonely World” as an attempt to extend his insular artistry. It’s a sonic mission that recruits some of the most viciously capable contemporary musicians—Thundercat, Animals as Leaders’ Tosin Abasi, Son Lux drummer Ian Chang—to craft counterpoints and supporting textures for Sumney’s intricate harmony stacks. The result is a song that begins as a flickering flame, eventually fanning into a chaotic wildfire before it’s extinguished with a whisper.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_71,2016,Smile,Evan Rytlewski,"These are usually some of the most fun rap songs: When a newly famous artist returns to his neighborhood to flaunt his newfound stature for awed childhood friends and rub his success in the face of anybody who doubted it. For a victory lap, though, Isaiah Rashad’s trip back to his native Chattanooga, Tenn., is pretty bumpy. On “Smile,” the TDE rapper wakes in a fog of depression, gets in a seriously ugly spat with his baby mama, picks a losing argument about Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter IV, and struggles to resist the bar of Xanax tucked in his back pocket. The beat is convincingly triumphant—a Southern-fried flip of a savory Brazilian soul number—but when Rashad brags about kicking back and enjoying his worry-free life, the person he’s most trying to convince is himself.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_70,2016,Existence in the Unfurling,Andy Beta,"This year brought to light the talents of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, whose use of the Buchla Music Easel announced a new voice on the device. Her third album, EARS, was one of the most exhilarating experimental albums of the year, an ever-shifting landscape in which to lose yourself. And it all led to the majesty of the closing track, the 11-minute epic “Existence in the Unfurling.” Amid the fretting arpeggios of her Buchla, Smith’s digitally warped vocals emerged from the circuits, only to camouflage themselves anew amid the timbres of fluttering woodwinds and saxophones. As the piece expands past the three-minute mark, it transforms into a sonic odyssey, exploring a realm between minimal composition and transcendental electronics, providing in this wearying year a much-needed source of wonderment.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_69,2016,Prima Donna,Jayson Greene,"In the first verse of “Prima Donna,” the highlight from his hard, baleful EP of the same name, Vince Staples buys a new house and blows his brains out on the kitchen wall. Women stop by afterward to admire the splatter, thinking it’s modern art. That’s a Vince Staples joke. Ha ha. Vince has never really been one for inclusive humor: He wants it to hurt when he elbows your ribs. The production by DJ Dahi hurts, too: Each downbeat sounds like a collapsing column Staples barely dodges. When he makes fun of himself, the pain is still there: As a newly minted star, he is going to “pull a Wavves on the Primavera Stage,” maybe the least glamorous self-destructive behavior a rapper could boast about. His airless squeak of a voice bounces around inside a hollowed-out beat, which nosedives and the end, his voice disappearing into a blender with an A$AP Rocky sample. When it's over, we’re left with ashes and ambivalence, as we are with every great Vince Staples song.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_68,2016,Girlfriend,Brad Nelson,"Nao’s particular variety of R&B has the efficiency and even the pneumatic qualities of good design, every instrument angled or curved so that it sounds assembled without any human intervention. The chorus of “Girlfriend” is like this: the guitar, synth, and Nao’s voice collapsing into a single harmonic cylinder. If it could be hung in an art gallery, it might look like a tube of neon. But within this precisely shaped environment, Nao primarily expresses anxiety, as if she’s reacting to a kind of airlessness around her. “Feels like pretty doesn’t know me/Only shows up when I’m lonely,” Nao sings, her voice generating internal harmonies like Prince, from whom the phrasing of the chorus is sort of borrowed, and from which the fractal design of her harmonies is certainly borrowed. The song’s construction is sensitive to this; whenever Nao’s vocal doubles or triples, the track itself seems to hiss with pleasure.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_67,2016,OOOUUU,Jace Clayton,"Rap crews and studio wizards have long known that a hit song comes when you capture the vibe of friends wildin’ out and crystallize their energy as sound. No song this year did that better than Young M.A’s self-released breakout hit “OOOUUU.” The title alone is a kind of litmus test: How you say it reveals your level of excitement and conviction. The Brooklyn rapper sing-slurs it, confident and drunk, boasting and charismatic, six letters that spelled arrival when “OOOUUU” made rounds on the street before rap royalty started jumping on remixes. M.A and her crew stunt in the video—another winning vibe that has landed more than 100 million party-crashing views. A young brown lesbian bending a male-dominated industry around her flow—this is a story we need to hear and repeat. But what’s the limit of a vibe? Explaining how she wasn’t going to explain a line in the song, M.A said: “All the dykes out there, they know exactly what I’m talking about. It ain’t for a guy to understand. If you don’t understand, you don’t gotta understand it.”",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_66,2016,The Greatest,Vanessa Okoth-Obbo,"During the intro to “The Greatest,” right as the ladies of KING ask, “Who wants a run with the number one?”, there is a short glissando on the keyboards. This sound, and all its variations, is one of the best things you can hear in an R&B song: a cue to get ready because it’s. About. To. Go. Down. The band immediately delivers on this promise, letting the synths kick fully before launching into three minutes of pure electro-soul bliss. The track’s harmonies and retro flourishes give it the feel of an ’80s R&B love song. And while that’s certainly part of the story, KING are more concerned with self-love: the belief that you can be the best at whatever you set your mind to. The single, off their debut We Are KING, was written in honor of Muhammad Ali, “the modern marvel man to stand behind.” A few months after we got “The Greatest,” we lost the Greatest—making what was already a terrific song work doubly as a tribute to Ali’s legacy of winning.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_65,2016,Adore,Laura Snapes,"“Adore” was born as a song about Savages frontwoman Jehnny Beth’s refusal to suppress her desires. “Is it human to adore life?” she asks over and over, pitying the repressed and their prudish norms. Nearly 12 months and untold tragedies later, her question now sounds like a radical act of resistance. She repeats it with a cool steadiness, as if jutting her jaw in the face of someone who’s determined to break her; when the chorus drives towards a crescendo worthy of Queen, Beth pulls back and lets her question hang as a lonely provocation rather than a proclamation of false triumph. Clinging to hope in a condemned landscape, she pulls off the grave romance of the great fado and cabaret singers—until she turns her question into a statement. “I adore life,” she intones, first sadly, but then as a rapturous invocation, her voice ascending through key changes and effervescing alongside Savages’ apocalyptic climax. As we enter 2017, hope is a privilege, but love and truth are still the path to the sublime.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_64,2016,Be Apart,Cameron Cook,"When he first started Porches, the New York musician Aaron Maine played charming indie rock only really set apart by his insouciant tenor. On this year’s Pool, his first album on Domino, he almost completely ditched the guitars to make an off-kilter, laconic dance record, one in which his minimalist approach yielded to a new intimacy and lyrical sparsity. Like all good synthpop songs, “Be Apart” is immediately catchy, its keyboard line bouncing off like a poolside volleyball no one can be bothered to chase. “I wanna be apart/Of it all,” Maine croons, stuck in limbo between the exuberant discovery and blasé isolationism of youth. You can't get much more bedroom-pop than a song literally about not leaving home, and the anxious melancholy that seeps out of “Be Apart” is palpable.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_63,2016,Bum Bum Bum,Mike Powell,"A good Cass McCombs song is like a locked door: mysterious, resolute, matter-of-fact, inaccessible. Whether there’s anything behind it or not is irrelevant. “I’m not here to convince anyone to like what I do,” McCombs said about his most recent album, Mangy Love. “I’m really comfortable with people disliking it,” he went on hermetically, adding that he wasn’t sure he liked it himself. “Sent a letter to my congressman, the Ku Klux Klan, from my pierced hands,” he sings on “Bum Bum Bum.” “They sent me back an Apple phone, a fine-hair comb and a bell tolled.” In one line, he plays the cynic, the satirist, the surrealist, the citizen of disgust—in other words, an authentic Californian, wise to bullshit but still up for the occasional smudge stick. The band grooves behind him like soft-rock scarred by an indigestible truth. Never the kind of guy for whom people start fan clubs, McCombs continues to find his purpose outside comfort, in the lost art of questioning everything.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_62,2016,Controlla,Renato Pagnani,"In an era when Drake songs about women feel colder than a Toronto winter—callous, hardened, without optimism—“Controlla” is a reminder that he can still turn on the charm when he wants to. Rather than stew in his usual contempt, Drake spends the duration of the VIEWS hit attempting to prove his worthiness, emphasizing his dedication (“I made plans with you, and I won’t let them fall through”) and willingness to take her needs seriously (“I do it how you say you want it”). And, because it’s Drake, being a little bit extra: “I think I’d die for you/Jodeci ‘Cry for You.’” The music slinks down the Jamaican coastline, painting in reds and oranges rather than his usual muted blues and grays. “My last girl would tear me apart, but she never wanna split a ting with me,” he sings, yearning for true collaboration. It low-key might be the most romantic thing Drake has ever sung.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_61,2016,Blood on Me,Mark Richardson,"London’s Sampha has made his name so far as a guest vocalist, singing on tracks by SBTRKT, Drake, Jessie Ware, and more. His ability to blend in with such different surroundings speaks to his flexibility and expressive range; his great skill is to find the essential feeling at the heart of a song and amplify it. “Blood on Me,” a single from his forthcoming debut album (due early next year), is a song built around a single emotion: fear. As Sampha moves through the breathless set-up, we follow him as he flees nameless and faceless pursuers down dark alleyways. Somehow he manages to convey paranoia, anxiety, panic, and desperation while never losing sight of the melody, and when the chorus arrives and the tension explodes, it’s pure catharsis.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_60,2016,1990x,Brian Howe,"This was another boundary-bulging year for R&B, but every experiment needs a control group. Maxwell played that role beautifully with “1990x,” a song that sounds old but doesn’t feel it. The gleaming chamber-funk arrangement is zippered together with contemporary tightness, while the music is both hard and soft, as if made of the glares and glints of a revolving diamond. All this incandescence is faintly ironic: Though he now often sports perfectly tailored suits, in the ’90s Maxwell was part of a countercurrent to the shiny suit era, dousing R&B in oceanic cool, beatific consciousness, and earthy threads alongside the likes of Erykah Badu and D’Angelo. He’s always been a little out of time and off-trend, which is apt of his music’s fundamental appeal—an insistence on revving up weathered musical modes with fresh insight and an evolving perspective. In a year when R&B was ruled by youthful passions and roiling politics, Maxwell brought back classic soul with lyrics that weren’t about protest, predation, or property, but about what it’s really like to be in love, a bubble he has a rare talent for pausing and thinking inside of. “1990x” is sex music for grown people who’ve gotten past all that conquest and insecurity stuff, somehow capturing the silence of the romantic moment in lush, vivid sound. It’s music for having, not for wanting; a song for knowing who you are, not searching for it.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_59,2016,No Woman,Jesse Jarnow,"Drop “L.A.” into a song lyric (as Whitney do in the third line of “No Woman”) and it will generally establish a few basics—announcing the song as part of a long pop continuum of songs about Los Angeles, evoking a mindset and a myth as well as the actual city. A brief mention of L.A. is the only concrete detail in “No Woman,” and it acts as a floating emotional signpost as much as a physical place. Starring Max Kakacek and Julien Ehrlich, both ex-Smith Westerns, and drawn from their affable debut Light Upon the Lake, the song is a tale of lost love and wandering, with no fixed narrative and a distinct lack of resolution. The “haze” Ehrlich sings about pervades “No Woman” like both California sunshine and the unnamed presence Ehrlich mourns. Produced by Foxygen’s Jonathan Rado, it also fogs over a cleverly unfolding arrangement that achieves density without drama, light percussion never quite succumbing to melodrama while horns and strings sway like props in the gentle breeze of the stage-set version of L.A., the one that lives most vividly in the imagination*.*",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_58,2016,Digits,Dean Van Nguyen,"Young Thug is rap’s enigma wrapped in contradiction—an ATLien swathed in Greek mythology, an androgynous fashion cognoscente who packs a pistol. And the paradoxes continue on “Digits.” Thugger counts his cash and flashes his ice on the song, but this is no gaudy show of strength. Over London on Da Track’s creeping keyboard riff, the rapper sounds mournful as he contemplates the unbreakable patterns facing all hustlers: “You can lose your life but it gon’ keep goin’.” But it’s the virtuosity of the performance—his nimble, infinitely melodic flow at its most tuneful—that makes this a standout moment from an artist who takes joy in eluding any type of final form.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_57,2016,VRY BLK,Marcus J. Moore,"As I type this, another police officer has gotten away with killing a black man. This time, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a prosecutor has determined Brentley Vinson’s actions were justified in the September shooting of Keith L. Scott. It’s the latest in what feels like a brutal assault on black people at the hands of law enforcement: Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Sandra Bland, and the list goes on. On “VRY BLK,” singer Jamila Woods fights racial oppression with a regal sense of purpose, declaring her blackness with the utmost pride and nobility. Woods asks bold questions, holding cops accountable for their actions. “If I say that I can’t breathe, will I become a chalk line?” she wonders. “Your serving and protecting is stealing babies’ lives.” This song—like others from her excellent debut album, HEAVN—outlines the beauty of being black, using cavernous soul to punctuate the theme. It speaks to the connection you feel with fellow people of color. No matter who you are, you’re still family.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_56,2016,Panda,Noah Yoo,"If you had to name the most ubiquitous debut of 2016, it would likely be Desiigner with his mega-hit “Panda.” While the general public’s introduction to the song came through Kanye’s The Life of Pablo, “Panda” quickly took on a life of its own and became unavoidable—it got played in the club, blasted on the street, and stuck in your head for hours at a time. “Panda” is ominous but also great fun thanks to its knocking drums, lurching strings, and constant stream of ad-libs. It’s a case study in the modern conglomeration of rap: A New York rapper buys a beat from a London producer he’s never met and crafts a Southern hip-hop song that ends up topping the charts.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_55,2016,1st Day Out tha Feds,Mehan Jayasuriya,"“First Day Out Tha Feds” is a homecoming anthem in the truest sense. Gucci Mane wrote the lyrics during a three-year stint in federal prison, recorded the vocal within an hour of returning home, and released the song less than 24 hours after his release. But even though this song introduced the world to Gucci Mane 2.0—trim, self-possessed, exacting in his delivery—it’s hardly triumphant. The new Gucci is sober in more ways than one: Off alcohol and drugs for the first time in 17 years, he’s now taking an unflinching look at his former life. The track’s accounts of prison life are harrowing, but its most striking moments occur when Gucci turns his focus inward. “I did some things to some people that was downright evil,” he raps, before admitting, “My own mama turned her back on me/And that’s my mama.” Thankfully, the story has a happy ending: Gucci has never looked better, often appearing so grateful to be on earth that he’s downright beaming. But as “First Day Out Tha Feds” reminds us, this happiness was hard won.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_54,2016,Hallucinations,Matthew Strauss,"“Hallucinations” solidified dvsn. It was the fourth and final single released ahead of Sept. 5th, the debut from the once-mysterious Toronto duo of Daniel Daley and Nineteen85, who up to that point had specialized in slow jams. While the song didn’t rewrite dvsn’s entire ethos, it finally showcased Daley’s impressive vocal capabilities, reaching higher places with newfound verve. Nineteen85’s production chops were never in question—he’s the architect behind some of Drake’s greatest pop hits—but instead of providing atmosphere, “Hallucinations” builds with Daley’s falsetto in mind. Lyrically, Daley conveys only necessary details, leaving enough room for listeners to fill in with their own memories. Most who’ve endured heartbreak can understand how disorienting it feels to now only see the one you love in dreams. dvsn capture the haunting accurately, with wounded beauty rather than gut-wrenching pain.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_53,2016,Glowed Up,Nate Patrin,"The lines between hip-hop, house, R&B, and bass music have never felt as blurred as they have in the past few years, with 2016’s most compelling example arriving via Kaytranada. The Montreal-based, Haitian-born producer’s debut, 99.9%, shows off so many different ways to build a groove that singling out a centerpiece feels reductive. “Glowed Up” is a standout in part because it powerfully contrasts the slippery elasticity of the upbeat dance cuts. Consider it a dizzy comedown after a steady dose of stimulants, a mid-album respite of E-funk that’s halfway between L.A. Reid and L.A. beats. That latter factor is not just Anderson .Paak-driven, though the obvious charm comes from his wiseass strut-drawl—half toilet jokes (“No bullshit in mi casa/Laxatives in your chowder”), half resilient artistry in the face of fame’s looming pressures (“Even when you’re far out there in the sun/You’re still in the hands of the one who cares for you”). It’s also the fact that the beat’s air-suspension glide really does shine like a full-spectrum light, warm chords where Brian Wilson’s theremin meets Junie Morrison’s ARP. That it finds an extra gear to rev low in during the left-turn third verse is just showing off, and the best kind of it.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_52,2016,Who Shot Me?,Paul A. Thompson,"On June 12, 2015, a still-unknown assailant opened fire on YG outside an apartment complex in Studio City, California. One bullet hit the rapper in the hip; YG and his friends drove to the hospital. He refused to cooperate with the cops and checked himself out after less than 24 hours. For a year after the shooting, YG’s only comment of substance on the incident was an aside in his song “Twist My Fingaz”: “I tried to pop first, got popped at/Got hit in the hip, couldn’t pop back.” But “Who Shot Me?,” the second song from his superb Still Brazy, deals with the psychological fallout. The color of his would-be killer’s pistol sticks in his brain, beside a list of suspects and designs for potential R.I.P. t-shirts. Through it all, YG’s more concerned with the mental states of his friends and family than he is with beating his chest. He’s cool and calm, unnervingly so. You learn a lot about yourself in a crisis.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_51,2016,Earth to Heaven,Katherine St. Asaph,"Emily’s D+Evolution, Esperanza Spalding’s first album since besting Justin Bieber at the Grammys, has finally earned the jazz musician plaudits beyond the world’s music students and academy elders. “Earth to Heaven” isn't the most surprising cut on the album—see the plunging vocals of “Good Lava” or the cover from the Willy Wonk**a soundtrack—but it’s the most indicative. There’s funk and art-rock in the hopper, but also Joni Mitchell and Stephen Sondheim. Spalding’s phrasing is that of an actress, flipping nimbly from coy to blunt in the space of one line. There’s plenty of material to work with here: Spalding’s pilgrim’s prog moves dispassionately from Ecclesiastes to science to earthy self-help. It always returns to the same idea, though: getting to heaven, maybe, but in the meantime driving a groove into the ground. “All legacies end here,” Spalding sings. Theologically, perhaps. Musically? Not remotely.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_50,2016,Human Performance,Andrew Gaerig,"Parquet Courts have a reputation as the kind of obtuse, smirking lit-punks that built the indie rock pyramids of yore, so it’s notable that “Human Performance” is about pop music’s most basic-ever sentiment: grieving lost love. The song contains no double entendres or glancing witticisms; even the central conceit—that, minus love, singer Andrew Savage is a husk merely acting as a human—is well-trodden ground. The change in tone makes you realize how Savage’s lyrical jigsaws can be affecting instead of dazzling, how he’s able to turn familiar sentiment into striking lines by breaking in odd places and lovingly positioning his syllables. It is the first Parquet Courts song I have walked away from feeling that Savage is not smarter than me, but sadder.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_49,2016,CHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum,Philip Sherburne,"We’re not used to hearing Aphex Twin dole out slow-motion, four-to-the-floor beats—and at just 100 BPM, “CHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum]” dips about as low as techno is inclined to go. But that sullen andante trudge allows the British electronic musician to get the most out of the unusual instrument that the song pays homage to, and which he presumably used to record it: the Cheetah MS800, a digital synthesizer known for its woozy timbres (and once described as “the most difficult instrument to program on the planet”). Here, that translates to background pads that shimmer like a heat mirage, and a midrange bass melody that writhes like a greased pig on ice. It’s unusual to hear Aphex Twin strip his tracks down like this, but that focus on the texture of his sounds—and few producers know how to program a synthesizer quite like he does—ends up making this no-frills record one of his most immediately satisfying releases in ages.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_48,2016,E.V.P.,Jayson Greene,"“E.V.P.” starts with a fat synth belch, like rubber boots squawking on wet linoleum. A studio rat as well as a solo act, Dev Hynes is especially good with evocative noises, and that synth seems to arrive straight from New York’s Danceteria circa-1982, still draped in scarves and trailing glitter. The song it announces is the centerpiece of his luminous and compassionate album Freetown Sound, and it pulls all of that album’s various threads—yearning for freedom, awareness of injustice, unbridled joy at the presence of the body, fear for its vulnerability—into one dense, breathing heat of tangled limbs and yearning. On an album containing a metropolis of characters, cameos, and sonic details, “E.V.P.” is the most populous: Every sound, from the neener-neener synth whines and stiff funk guitars evoking “Slippery People” to the scratchy Arthur Russell strings, impart some indescribable flavor to the broth. It all resolves into a melody so generous it nearly overflows the borders of the song. No one wrote a chorus of this scale all year, or even seemed to try. In “E.V.P.” Hynes is alone, soaring unaccompanied in the sky.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_47,2016,All Night,Marc Hogan,"Chance the Rapper does not want you to ride home in his car. To hear Knox Fortune, the Chicago singer and producer who lilts the song’s boozy hook, tell it, this ungenerous theme was the original concept behind “All Night.” But Chance is nothing if not magnanimous. The reasons he gives for refusing to chauffeur our drunk asses—we talk politics, we falsely claim to be his cousin, we fart—are amusing enough to be worth the rejection. Kaytranada’s tipsy instrumental, which posits Chance snugly within Chicago’s deep house legacy, also evokes SaveMoney crew founder Vic Mensa’s 2014 house love letter “Down on My Luck” (previously remixed by the Montreal producer). But like Chance’s gleefully eccentric, shape-shifting lyrical observations, the strobe-lit four-on-the-floor thump here is irresistibly inviting. Turns out, the most extroverted song on Coloring Book was a sly curmudgeon’s plea for privacy.",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_46,2016,A 1000 Times,Jonah Bromwich,"Hamilton Leithauser didn’t need Rostam Batmanglij’s help to go pop—fans of the singer’s old band, the Walkmen, know that his voice alone can convey the urgency of a radio jam. So just short of the 30-second mark on the tragic “A 1000 Times,” when Leithauser uncorks his signature yelp, it doesn’t feel like something new. It feels like rediscovery, a welcome return. That sensation is a perfect fit for a song that drifts through the past as it charts the winter to come, acknowledging both the constant temptation of unrequited love and the hard reality that it’s all an overbaked fantasy. Meanwhile, Batmanglij’s touches—the playful keys, the harmonies, a carnival atmosphere reminiscent of Vampire Weekend’s best—offer the type of subtle accompaniment that takes a song from good to great, forging a wistful epic that’s in line with the hurt at the song’s heart.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_45,2016,I Have Been to the Mountain,Sam Hockley-Smith,"“I Have Been to the Mountain” is a misleadingly upbeat track that’s actually about the death of Eric Garner, killed by police after repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” The song, built on a tense bass line, guitar skronk, a horn section, and a choir, is also an explicit rejection of cynicism. Kevin Morby’s voice has settled into a curved and pockmarked take on young Bob Dylan, humming with wisdom and, because it’s necessary, some spite too. “I Have Been to the Mountain” is about injustice, and helplessness in the face of injustice, but it’s also about that feeling that when things go inexorably wrong, the only thing anyone can do is work to make them better.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_44,2016,Come Down,Marc Hogan,"“Come Down” is equal parts celebration and warning. Anchored by a fat G-funk bassline, the standout track from Anderson .Paak’s solo breakthrough Malibu sways under the weight of the artist’s hard-earned braggadocio. Even though he knows ascending to greater heights could lead to a longer, harder fall, he can’t help but flirt with the edge. One moment, a group of onlookers taunts, “You might not ever come down!”; the next, he flips it and channels James Brown, shouting, “Wanna get down!” The Hi-Tek production is remarkably spacious, but .Paak finds a way to fill out that space by imagining the people and sounds in it, including rowdy crowds, his own multiple personas, and—why not—a clip from the 1978 Malibu surf movie Big Wednesday. It’s his world, after all. He can get as high as he wants. —Minna Zhou",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_43,2016,Girls @,Jazz Monroe,"Save Money crew-member Joey Purp’s latest, iiiDrops, tackles the multitudes of his native Chicago, veering between frustration and frivolity, political verve and spiritual angst. One of a few excursions is standout jam “Girls @,” buoyed on a Neptunes-catchy Knox Fortune beat and heaps of irreverent glee. Purp spends half of it winking to the camera, seemingly fretting over “Where the girls at?” while playfully notching up his date demands: credit cards, heels, Birkin bags, and a topless Benz. In truth, he sounds more impish than self-serious, like a cruising bachelor giggling to his buddy in the passenger seat, indiscriminately firing champagne emoji into their address books. When Chance chimes in, he’s all lovable chutzpah: He eyes a bookworm “reading Ta-Nehisi Coates, humming ‘SpottieOttieDope’” then goofily asks to borrow a girl’s iPhone and car. His absurd charm—“Where the mid-sized girls? You bad!”—should make Purp’s flash ridiculous; instead, they sync like a glorious double act.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_42,2016,Lockjaw,Jay Balfour,"French Montana has made a career out of being upstaged. On song after song, he has charmingly brought someone more popular to the party, like Nicki Minaj or Drake, and proceeded to bask in their glow. But the Bronx-raised MC has quirks and chops worthy of a main attraction, and on “Lockjaw,” he graduates to big-brother status and invites upstart Kodak Black to shine on his dime. They’re not an obvious pair—Kodak slurs out in croaks, French mumbles in a conversational sing-song—but the duo are entirely complementary in the moment, boasting through gritted, MDMA-addled teeth. The beat’s hard drums make it instantly familiar as its eerie background echoes ensure this song never grows old. It’s an anthem that demands open car windows and doors, an invitation to bite down and stunt.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_41,2016,Sorry,Ryan Dombal,"“Sorry” is not sorry. Not even close. Beyoncé’s most flagrant kiss-off of the year is cold as fuck, but there’s no angst, no furrowed brows, no lashing out. She glides through her revenge as effortlessly as a figure skater, carving an outline of her oppressor’s severed head into ice. She flips the bird for fun. She has the balls to grab her crotch. She turns two words—“boy” and “bye”—into a devastating GIF factory. The essential video only goes deeper, as she expands the song’s meaning across time and place. The interiors were shot at Louisiana’s Madewood Plantation, a grand locale that once hosted brutal beatings of slaves and now hosts Queen Bey in a throne and Serena Williams as her twerking accomplice. Beyoncé and her chorus line of ancient spirits also sport body paint from the Yoruba tradition, white ink imbued with a lasting sacredness. And then there’s Becky and her good hair—a throwaway whodunit wrapped in pointed racial signifiers. At the end of the video, Beyoncé lets out a photo-ready smile before quickly turning deadly serious and delivering that guillotine chop of a final line. She’s in complete control. She’s having a great time, but she’s not kidding around.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_40,2016,Kanye West,Nathan Reese,"Hip-hop has always been mercurial, but in 2016, fluidity itself—from form, to function, to delivery—became rap’s defining trait. Young Thug’s “Kanye West” is this trend crystallized, melted down, and imbibed via ayahuasca ceremony in an Atlanta club basement. The track went through several working titles—“Elton John,” “Wet Wet,” “Pop Man”—but the final is most fitting. Just as The Life of Pablo tried to turn the idea of an album into an ever-changing endeavor, Thugger sees music as a product of the moment; titles matter little, albums less, and songs gush from the internet like water from a spigot. The production is almost totally removed from a traditional trap sound, filled with humid tones, booming 808s, and childlike flourishes—it’s as if Phil Collins, circa Disney’s Tarzan soundtrack, made a song about anal sex and female ejaculation. Then there’s Wyclef laying down dad-rap couplets goofy enough to soften Young Thug’s filthiest metaphors: “Play truth or dare/Jumpin’ in the pool with no swim wear gear,” he sings. That the two vastly different artists collaborated at all boggles the mind, but the result is Young Thug at his most fully realized and fully weird.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_39,2016,It Means I Love You,Kevin Lozano,"You’d be hard pressed to assign a single genre signifier to what Jessy Lanza does in this song. Somehow, she crams Yellow Magic Orchestra, Mariah Carey, feverish footwork, and an infectious South African tabla beat into a terse and tightly compressed floor-filler. The more time you spend with it, the more it opens up and the more its composite pieces become mysterious. Her voice is just as coolly inscrutable as the beat as she hammers away at a few simple phrases: “When you look into my eyes boy/Then it means I love you.” Even when she disappears into the song’s thick shroud of beats, her confident presence remains palpable, and the song lingers in the ears like a fresh secret.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_38,2016,Do You Need My Love,Marc Masters,"The soft-rock melancholy of Weyes Blood’s “Do You Need My Love” has the faded feel of a lost classic—a ’70s AM-radio gem unearthed from a box of dusty 45s. The easiest comparison to make is to the bittersweet ballads of the Carpenters, and judged on that scale, Natalie Mering holds up well. Her wistful voice and the music’s richly textured arrangement strike a tone both soothing and sobering. She even adds a chorus of “ba-ba-ba”s to remind us this is pop music, not Sylvia Plath poetry. Still, “Do You Need My Love” exudes a darkness that even Karen Carpenter didn’t touch often. Mering’s opening sentiment—“tired of feeling so bad”—pervades the song. She sounds weary and lost, stuck in an eternal limbo of unrequited love. “Passion is the only thing/Passion must mean everything,” she insists, rationalizing her inability to think about anything else. As her doubts gather over swelling chords, “Do You Need My Love” starts to sound as much about our modern problems as hers. Like many people alive right now, Mering is caught in a land of questions without answers; hearing her give that feeling a voice is pretty inspiring.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_37,2016,Yesterday,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Noname is here to remind us of Chicago’s most lasting hip-hop tradition, one that provides a throughline from Chance to Kanye to Common to No I.D., leading all the way back to the city’s history as an incubator for jazz and soul. Her debut mixtape, Telephone, hearkens back to these roots; its sound is warm and sepia-toned. Fittingly, the album’s opening number, “Yesterday,” is all about remembrance. Noname memorializes a departed grandmother and brother, longs for her own childhood, and wonders who will remember her when she’s gone. The song’s chorus is simple, direct, and utterly heartbreaking: “When the sun is going down/When the dark is out to stay/I picture your smile, like it was yesterday.” As always, the future of Chicago rap remains inextricably bound to the city’s rich musical past.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_36,2016,untitled 02 | 06.23.2014.,Stuart Berman,"According to the entry dates on his demo/diary collection, untitled unmastered., Kendrick Lamar recorded this track just six days after he turned 27—an age that’s assumed grave significance in the annals of pop history. Fittingly, “untitled 02” represents the purest, most potent distillation of the survivor’s guilt that wracks so many of his rhymes. It may not have made the cut for his 2015 masterpiece To Pimp a Butterfly, but in its Compton-via-Cotton Club trap-jazz sprawl and the conflicted ruminations on what it means to be a successful black man in modern America, “untitled 02” retroactively previews Lamar’s next album. It’s part Top Dawg Entertainment office party, part funeral for the friends who got locked up or gunned down. And nowhere is that inner tension and turmoil felt more acutely than in the line where TDE president Dave Free rolls up to show off his brand new Porsche 911, and all Lamar can think of is planes crashing into buildings.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_35,2016,2 Phones,Matthew Strauss,"Plug, load, bitches, dough: Judging by the evidence of “2 Phones,” Kevin Gates’ life is more complicated than most. But on the song of his career (so far), he juggles the difficulties just fine. “2 Phones” is a song about distrust and near-paranoia, yet it feels fearless. The chorus is so catchy it invites mimicry, even parody—try replacing “phones” with two of whatever happens to be lying around you—but Gates isn’t joking, and the song is an anthem of desperation. His multiple phones are a necessity, as an alternate means for survival had music not panned out. Fortunately for Gates, that urgency manifested into a triumphant performance. Whatever the reason, the phone keeps ring ring ringing.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_34,2016,Summer Friends,Mark Richardson,"Chance the Rapper’s “Summer Friends” packs an astonishing amount of detail into less than five minutes. By the time the Chicago rapper runs down the people, places, and things that surrounded him as a kid—from JJ and Mikey and Lil Derek to day camp to the dollar bills he folded like lawn chairs after mowing yards—you feel like you’re watching a film with wide shots and saturated colors, eyes darting from one image to the next. Chance’s rapid, uninflected sing-song delivery jumps from section to section in order to get everything in; he’s sitting with us in the present moment, while the ghostly vocals carry the ache of the past. His story juxtaposes the simple innocence of childhood with the danger and complexity that, for those who grow up in a certain time and place, is always lurking just outside the frame.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_33,2016,Broccoli,Marc Hogan,"People love an underdog story. We also seem to love goofy songs about weed. “Broccoli” is both. Virginian font of sing-song hip-hop euphoria, D.R.A.M., in his joyful warble, recounts with touching matter-of-factness how he went from a precocious preschooler to the 26-year-old owner of an unlikely 2015 hit called, of all things, “Cha Cha,” and then on to noshing on lox and capers at a restaurant as strangers gawk. Now 28, he has another sleeper success in this collaboration with likeminded Atlanta rapper Lil Yachty. Released first on SoundCloud, consisting of little more than Yachty flirting around and D.R.A.M. braying infectiously (also “sleazily,” “greasily”) about pesos and Alfredo, all over a cheerful keys-and-claps loop, “Broccoli” ended up going top five. In February, it will vie for a Grammy against Drake’s “Cha Cha”-indebted “Hotline Bling.” If grinningly ridiculously ear to ear for almost four minutes is therapeutic, then loving “Broccoli” may actually be good for you, too. —Marc Hogan",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_32,2016,No More Parties in LA,Raymond Cummings,"Essentially a microcosm track of The Life of Pablo, “No More Parties in L.A.” may just be Kanye West’s most urgently scatterbrained banger. Despite 12 songwriter credits, it seems nearly accidental, like West’s real-time fever dream jammed between conference calls, gym sets, and Twitter bouts. So swathes of Walter Morrison, Ghostface Killah, Larry Graham, and Johnny “Guitar” Watson cuts are accordioned into tangled, thorny funk; so guest MC Kendrick Lamar, reveling in his recent triumphs, is at his punniest here. (“Come Erykah Badu me/Well, let’s make a movie.”) “No More Parties” feels vital and alive because West seems to have more thoughts percolating than he can express. All is breathless shorthand: the gesticulated self-mythology surveying, the Glamorama SparkNotes, the over-specific sex-talk, that cock-eyed callback to “Real Friends,” the unmistakable impression that West’s got more creative irons in the fire than there are hours in the day. “Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam/Thank God for me” segues neatly into “Whole family getting money/Thank God for E!” The lyric, like the song as a whole, links West’s past, present, and future—he is rapping like we never thought he would again, even though he’s light-years removed from the baller with a backpack who used to wear bear costumes on his album sleeves.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_31,2016,Dis Generation,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,"We Got It From Here...Thank You 4 Your service operates on several levels: It is a revival and a requiem, an affirmation and a farewell. “Dis Generation” functions as its fulcrum, providing a pivot between A Tribe Called Quest’s past and a hip-hop that will exist without them. To that end, Q-Tip nods at Joey Badas$$, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole, but he’s not so much passing the torch as placing the new guard into a continuum that predates him. Even so, the hazy, soulful shimmer of “Dis Generation” deliberately evokes A Tribe Called Quest’s prime. In sampling Musical Youth’s “Pass the Dutchie” for its hook, they draw a direct line back to 1992, when the same song provided a rhythm for the “Vampire Mix” of “I Left My Wallet in El Segundo”—and the group revels in the lush production, trading jokes, devoting a large passage to compatriot Busta Rhymes, and looking at the present with clear eyes. In “Dis Generation,” A Tribe Called Quest bridge eras with poignant joy, writing with a sense of middle-aged wisdom about what’s been gained and lost, still hopeful for what’s to come. Even if things won’t be like they once were, culture is built upon the passing of generations.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_30,2016,One Dance,Marc Hogan,"Drake’s business model has proven to be very successful. It’s basic licensing: When he hears something he likes, he stamps his name on it, adds a few verses from his tried-and-tested playbook, and calls it a hit. So it goes with “One Dance,” arguably the earworm of the year. The song includes two features: one of them a sample of the all-but-unknown singer Kyla Reid, whose velvety voice provides an essential hook, along with echoey punctuations by Nigerian artist Wizkid. These valuable outsiders provide the foundation to which “One Dance” returns whenever Drake’s stock melodicism needs a jolt of momentum. But is Drake’s strategy canny tastemaking or stealth exploitation? Kyla was thrilled when the song was released with her name on it; she pissed off her neighbors by blasting it 20 times in a row. “Once Dance” has since hit No. 1 in over 10 countries. It became the most streamed song in Spotify’s history. The business model works again. Everyone’s happy. —Jonah Bromwich",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_29,2016,22 (OVER S∞∞N),Kevin Lozano,"Bon Iver’s 22, A Million is far from the kind of music made for mass consumption, yet something about it resonated for many. Through a thick haze of newfound inscrutability and looping weariness, Justin Vernon’s voice emerges as one of the most powerful tools in music. Opening track “22 (OVER S∞∞N)” is comprised of sounds that often seem broken, or maybe just organized with chaos in mind. But his voice corrals everything together, allowing those brief pockets of sweet saxophone hiss, swells of strings, and spectral choruses to have direct emotional impact. The tangling of Vernon’s recent digital inhumanity with warm empathy makes for something that is poignant for reasons that are hard to articulate, but viscerally felt nonetheless.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_28,2016,Hold Up,Katherine St. Asaph,"Lemonade is Beyoncé’s most reflective album, as she refuses to play the one-dimensional scorned woman the past few years of tabloids have reduced her to. “Hold Up” finds her peeved (to say the least), but she doesn’t sound peeved. The samples are a bit prickly, a bit twitchy, but the track ultimately projects calm—an Andy Williams fragment ends up somewhere between new age and reggae—and the video is as much about smashing shit as dancing around the shards with the whole neighborhood. It’s a stream of consciousness—Beyoncé’s vocals and lyrics outpace the track throughout—but for all the emotional liability, the fears about “looking jealous or crazy,” and the vow to fuck up a bitch, the lyrics are ultimately completely contained. As always, what Beyoncé presents the listener is utterly unflappable, idle musings upon lodging a baseball bat into the windshield of the unworthy. To call her “crazy” would be wrong; it’s a mark of skill and gravitas that “Hold Up” makes perfect sense.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_27,2016,I Need You,Andy Beta,"In a break between sessions for what would become Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds’ 16th album, Cave’s 15-year-old son Arthur fell to his death from the white cliffs of Brighton. And while the music was mostly arranged and all the lyrics written by that point, that tragedy shadows Skeleton Tree like a ghost. For grief of this magnitude and proximity, words founder for even the stoutest of poets. And while Cave’s ink-black prose has detailed death of every sort over the decades, on “I Need You,” you can hear him abut that wordless void, dealing with a pain that rekindles in line at the grocery store. “Nothing really matters” and “I need you” are as timeworn as any string of three words can be, but even if Cave can’t quite suss a new metaphor, he contorts his voice to convey the anguish instead. He drawls out these lines like an old country act as Bad Seed Warren Ellis shadows that heartache via his microKORG. Wringing the rrr of “matters” and eee of “need” like a dishrag, Cave reveals an unsounded sadness and the paucity of language to express it.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_26,2016,Really Doe,Seth Colter Walls,"Several tracks on Atrocity Exhibition portray Danny Brown in a state of private anxiety, but “Really Doe” displays the MC at a peak of ebullience and oddball sociability. Over droning bass tones and a manic xylophone loop, the Detroit rapper proffers sex brags full of unexpected metaphor (“That hoe want my piccolo”), and compares the force of his rhyming to the blast from a C4 explosive. His emphatic release is matched by everyone else on this posse cut: Kendrick Lamar switches up speeds and rhythmic stresses, handling the chorus with a couplet that claps back against rivals. (“I ain’t boomin’—that’s a goddamn lie, whoa/Really doe, like really doe.”) Earl Sweatshirt pivots from “countin’...dubs” to hanging “on a mountain with monks.” And Ab-Soul giddily recalls snatching his mom’s wedding ring for a session of elementary school “show-and-tell.” The upside is obvious: When you’re getting sick of your own interiority, invite some of your more intrepid friends over to the house.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_25,2016,Nikes,Marcus J. Moore,"In the years since 2012’s magnificent* Channel Orange*, we eventually stopped asking when, but if there’d ever be a new Frank Ocean album. He’d drop a song or two, tease us with sporadic Tumblr posts, then fade into the ether just as abruptly. So in a way, Blonde opener “Nikes” encapsulates everything Ocean has been to us in his career: moody, elusive, mysterious, heartwarming. Pitched to a nearly chipmunk falsetto, the singer looks at himself and his environment, wondering what’s become of such a beautiful mess. It’s woozy and all over the place, steeped in drunken sadness and off-the-cuff reflection. “Pour up for A$AP,” Ocean muses at one point. “R.I.P. Pimp C/R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me.” Still, “Nikes” isn’t just about societal ills, it’s a kiss-off to gold-diggers looking for a pay day: “These bitches want Nikes, they lookin’ for a check/Tell ’em it ain’t likely.” That sentiment isn’t a shock coming from a guy like Ocean, of course: You can get a piece of him, but don’t get too attached.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_24,2016,Daydreaming,Jazz Monroe,"“Daydreaming” begins—like countless Radiohead songs before it—in the midst of a nebulous disaster. But something’s different here. In an oeuvre animated by technological angst, political indignation, and the threat of ecological catastrophe, this song is rare in that it exists “beyond the point of no return,” instead of on its cusp. “It’s too late,” Thom Yorke concedes, his tone dripping elegant defeat. “The damage is done.” The song’s innocent title is misleading—there is a sense, in the sleepwalking piano motif and disembodied vocal fragments, of a post-traumatic, amnesiac daze. That the narrator’s circumstances remain shrouded feels less like Radiohead-being-Radiohead than a sort of radical expressionism, the work of someone who has waded so deep into troubled thoughts that only abstractions remain. Yet there is room, in Yorke’s coda, for a flicker of exposition: “Half of my life,” he sighs repeatedly, vocals reversed and entombed in reverb. Yorke, 47 when A Moon Shaped Pool came out, had recently separated from his partner of 23 years—about as long as Radiohead have been releasing music. “Daydreaming” is a reckoning with those years, and, in one way or another, an elegy to them.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_23,2016,I Can't Give Everything Away,Stacey Anderson,"For decades, David Bowie dropped the best breadcrumbs in rock, and embraced the fans who did the sleuthing: What fate befell Major Tom? Was the Thin White Duke steeped in the occult? So when his 25th album, Blackstar**, closed on an overtly cryptic note, it was easy to fall down this next rabbit hole, and wonder what, exactly, he was sing about atop this inquisitive jazz-pop. “With blackout hearts, with flowered news/With skull designs upon my shoes,” he sang resignedly—but was that a grace note of frustration? And how about that warbling, plaintive melody—what bounty was he withholding? It was the shortest Bowie or his followers ever reveled in one of his mysteries; two days after Blackstar’s release, he passed away. And so we learned that this beguiling, openhearted performer had created a gracious farewell with his final album, and particularly this song—the last this shepherd of the fringes would ever sing to his flock. It’s a gentle confirmation of what we knew: that he still had worlds within him, and that he would never have time to express them all. Because every time the song ends, Bowie is gone again.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_22,2016,Conceptual Romance,Laura Snapes,"In Chris Kraus’ I Love Dick, romantic rejection becomes its own form of creativity. Spurned by the sociologist Dick, Kraus in turn rejects consummation as the end point of infatuation, and in doing so, interrogates the intersection of failure and desire. Named for Kraus’ “conceptual romance,” the centerpiece track of Jenny Hval’s Blood Bitch finds the Norwegian visionary opening a similar portal. On the precipice of heartbreak, she loses herself in her “combined failures” rather than succumb to sentimentality, and she arrives at a revelation. “I understand infatuation, rejection/They can connect and become everything, everything that’s torn up in your life,” she sings, a faint trace of hysteria shaking her calm voice. Here, sensation and loss aren’t the voids they’re usually framed as, but the tangible fabric of existence. “Conceptual Romance” is an anthem for over-thinkers and individuals, for those who value anticipation over payoff. Though going by Hval’s insidious, dusky melody—the very best of her catalog to date—she’s more of a natural at seduction than she’d like to let on.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_21,2016,Don’t Touch My Hair,Britt Julious,"The personal is the political. And in Solange’s “Don’t Touch My Hair,” the political is black agency and resiliency in the face of the everyday. Blackness comes with certain truths in this country. Our blackness is laden with history, adversity, and overcoming. For black women, that is especially true. Admission into white society often inscribes sacrifice of the mind and body. We suppress our emotions in the face of hate. But recently many black women have refused to suppress their hair and, in the process, reclaimed bodily autonomy. We will no longer conform. “Don’t Touch My Hair” gives these ideas musical form: “You know this hair is my shit/Rode the ride, I gave it time/But this here is mine,” Solange sings in the chorus. She has gone through the process of reclaiming her coils. And although its height and structure and beauty leave others in awe, her hair is not something to sully with your confusion or questions or hands. They are “the feelings I wear,” Solange sings, but also her “pride” and “glory.” It's not just hair. It was never just hair.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_20,2016,Fill in the Blank,Sam Sodomsky,"Car Seat Headrest’s Will Toledo burst through this year like he’d been preparing his whole life for it, making his previous work seem like merely a dress rehearsal. Throughout the dense and knotty songs on Teens of Denial, his first album of new material since signing to Matador Records, you can hear Toledo’s attempt to divulge all he knows: about drugs, about friendship, about youth, about life. But its opening number, “Fill in the Blank,” compressed the album’s 70-minute sprawl into one vicious rock song. When Toledo, dressed a bit like the cool older brother at his sister’s Bat Mitzvah, performed the song on Colbert this summer, he made its energy physical, stuttering and shaking with the song’s all-caps lyrics sheet projected behind him (“YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE DEPRESSED/YOU NEVER TRIED HARD ENOUGH TO LIKE IT”). Even as Toledo sings about having seen too much of the world, he doesn’t seem like he’s about to turn away in defeat; he’s now ready to take it all on.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_19,2016,You Want It Darker,Mike Powell,"There’s a beautiful story about Leonard Cohen that starts after his father’s funeral. Cohen was nine. Mourning, confused, faced with the infinite mystery of death, Cohen snipped the wing of one of his father’s bow ties, stuffed a small note inside it, and buried the tie in the yard. “I’ve been digging in the garden for years, looking for it,” Cohen said later. “Maybe that’s all I’m doing, looking for the note.” The story’s themes–ritual, testament, the unearthly ways we bear our earthly pain–became the anchors of Cohen’s songs. His 14th and final album, You Want It Darker, opens with its title track, written in direct address: “If you are the dealer, I’m out of the game/If you are the healer, it means I’m broken and lame.” Thirty years ago, he would’ve said the same thing to a lover, but at 82, he talks mostly to God. You think his voice—spectral, bottomless, the sound of wind sweeping across an empty cave—indicates a connection to the beyond, but Cohen’s explanation was more terrestrial: “500 tons of whiskey and, you know, a million cigarettes.” But that is—or was—Leonard Cohen, an artist for whom the gutters of life were shortcuts to heaven.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_18,2016,33 ‘GOD’,Philip Sherburne,"In between two incongruous moments—a tossed-off reference to the aggressively hip boutique hotel chain the Ace and a sped-up sample of country singer Jim Ed Brown’s “Morning”—something truly strange happens to Bon Iver’s “33 ‘GOD’”: It is besmirched by bird shit. You ears might not have noticed, but it's right there in the lyric video: What could pass for a manipulated string sample is rendered, in the style of a stage direction, as “(bird shit).” Its intended purpose is as inscrutable as anything in the song’s free-associative lyrics, which veer from diaristic fragments (“Sent your sister home in a cab”) to perfect couplets marrying the sublime with the quotidian (“I could go forward in the light/Well I better fold my clothes”). But that very inscrutability goes to the heart of what makes the song so fascinating—not just lyrically but also musically, as Vernon’s ruminative piano chords are tossed this way and that by odd squalls of digital interference. There’s clearly some kind of crisis of faith going on here; the song is prefaced by an excerpt from this oft-quoted passage from Psalm 22: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?” But Vernon’s willingness to crap on his own canvas proves his disinterest, even in the eyes of God, in taking himself too seriously. Perhaps everyone writing tortured genius exegeses of songs that were never meant to be unpacked should take a page from his book.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_17,2016,Am I Wrong,Nate Patrin,"Dancing and self-consciousness make for one of the uneasiest combinations in music. But Anderson .Paak makes it work on “Am I Wrong” by sneaking it in under the cover of a supremely self-assured performance, shooting off about free time being precious and social effort not going to waste. As far as deflections go, Schoolboy Q playing retro-disco “Love Boat” guest star is a major one; you'd be excused for thinking it's the heart of the track, all no-worries party liberation. And that electric-piano glow sparks daydreams of unheard circa-In Our Lifetime Marvin Gaye/Donald Byrd collaborations, but still pulses like it’s too wavy for ’80. Time’s precious, but only an extended 12” mix could make “Am I Wrong” sink in deeper—and leave plenty of room for ambivalence and confidence to hash things out.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_16,2016,Your Best American Girl,Jes Skolnik,"The lead single from Puberty 2—the album that took Mitski Miyawaki from being a good, heartfelt singer-songwriter to the architect of her own graceful vision—is a perfect glass terrarium of a song. Within it, heartaches grow like moss: the desire to be seen for who you truly are by the person you love, the chill of knowing that even the most tender touch can’t bridge some cultural gaps, the knowledge that you’ll have to say goodbye sooner than you wanted to. It’s both universally resonant and personally specific. Even the rock convention she adopts—contrasting spacious, stripped-down verses with a blown-out, full-bore chorus—is done deftly, and lands with a hollow ache. Turn this song in any direction and you’ll find a new perspective to view its tiny, complete world.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_15,2016,Best to You,Ian Cohen,"Dev Hynes is one model of what a pop auteur should aspire to in 2016: sonically omnivorous, constantly evolving, driven by righteous anger against systemic injustice while empowering marginalized people. But his best-known songs are about the way people hurt each other in the most intimate spaces. “Best to You” leaps from its hazy, funkadelic surroundings, a poison-penned duet wherein Hynes’ female counterpart plays against type. Empress Of’s Lorely Rodriguez begs to forfeit her independence and identity to be nothing to a someone of her choosing: “I can’t be the girl you want but I can be the thing you throw away.” And surely, some took Rodriguez’s airy delivery, the percolating, chillwave-meets-Afro-pop percussion, and the song’s title at face value and ignored the lyrics, including it on Spotify mixes as a presumptive love song. But the key is right there on Freetown Sound’s cover: That young couple in their bedroom might appear temporarily immune to the indignities that Hynes documents painfully on the rest of the album, but they're not safe from their own private cruelties.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_14,2016,Real Friends,Matthew Schnipper,"“Real Friends” is a sober moment amid Kanye West’s chaos. Primarily produced by West, the beat is relatively throwback and very tight, with echoed boom-bap drums and ambient keys that ring out, sad as hell. Here, Kanye delivers The Life of Pablo’s truest lines, a litany of complaints and regrets against himself, his family, and his friends. “When was the last time I remembered a birthday?/When was the last time I wasn’t in a hurry?” he asks himself, as if poring over diary pages. Then Ty Dolla $ign swoops in, backing him up, his golden warble the emotional underline to Kanye’s acid. The song nearly ends with Kanye vowing to “throw dirt” on his enemies, but then a chorus of angels enters from stage left and blesses the whole sorry state of affairs. It’s not a flashy song but an honest one.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_13,2016,Pink + White,Corey Smith-West,"Whether he’s casually sidestepping the Grammys, following up a No. 1 album with minimal tour dates, or emerging from a thorough profile with his mystique intact, Frank Ocean’s disregard for the status quo has defined his year. This fact is also evident throughout “Pink + White”’s chill-inducing waltz. The song relegates the world’s biggest pop star to an uncredited support vocal spot. Meanwhile, Frank’s lyrics flow in a stream of consciousness too meticulous to be candid. The images he paints feel at once heart-achingly intimate yet vague. He doesn’t name his muses. His stories arc without exposition or resolution. All this while he strings scenes of a post-Katrina New Orleans (“In the wake of a hurricane.../Nose dive in the flood lines/Tall tower of milk crates”) and waning childhood (“Remember life/Remember how it was/Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here”) into one of the sweetest melodies of 2016. At this point, it’s futile to try and pin Ocean down. His art is paradoxical at every level. The more critics attempt to parse his identity, the more fluid it becomes.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_12,2016,No Problem,Matthew Strauss,"“No Problem” is nothing but infectious. There’s a chipmunk soul vocal loop (not a sample), an instantly memorable and recognizable hook, and a callback to another great rap song. But despite its vibrancy—Chance the Rapper’s primary mode throughout Coloring Book—the song is a departure for Chance. Blessed with a voice that transitions seamlessly between rapping and singing, the Chicago artist has never leaned on Auto-Tune or other noticeable vocal enhancements. His light rasp and trademark yips are part of his charm. But on “No Problem,” he adds just enough of a computerized touch to make the song stand out without entering robotic territory. He also includes two big-name veterans on the track: Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz drop by and Chance laps them both, but there’s nothing competitive or bloodthirsty about the song. “No Problem” is Chance’s unsigned-artist manifesto, his way of him telling the major labels, “I can do what you can do, only much, much better.”",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_11,2016,We the People...,Seth Colter Walls,"Rappers can often be heard observing (and decrying) the differences between idealism and practicality. But on A Tribe Called Quest’s “We the People...”—the second track from their refined final album—they take this yardstick to the nation at large. After a synth-led introduction, Q-Tip’s first rhymes momentarily stall the song’s forward motion, as he throws down a challenge to the Constitution’s opening statement: “We don’t believe you/Cause ‘We the People’/Are still here in the rear/Yo, we don’t need you.” With the culture in a “killing off good young nigga mood,” the MC reports on a chasm that still exists between the nation’s abstract virtues and its daily, lived reality. After noting how gentrification threatens vulnerable communities, Q-Tip proposes a cynical redraft of the national credo: “All you Black folks, you must go/All you Mexicans, you must go/All you poor folks, you must go.” For good measure, he includes some other targets of resurgent white nationalist politics: “Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways.” The melody he attaches to this chorus is pointedly simplistic, near-monotone, and devoid of the vibrant personality of his opening bars. In the second verse, it’s up to the late Phife Dawg to reenergize the culture under assault. He does so with boldness and wit, nominating Tribe’s pluralist swagger as an aphrodisiac: “We got your missy smitten, rubbing on her little kitten/Dreaming of a world that's equal for women, with no division.”",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_10,2016,Black Beatles,Matthew Ramirez,"“Black Beatles” is the moment Mike WiLL Made-It discovers a new universe while Rae Sremmurd find new ways to plug their irresistible voices into the pocket. There’s an elemental depth to the composition—Mike WiLL is on some Steve Reich shit. Such an industrial, looming beat became the soundtrack to the viral Mannequin Challenge where people froze, a tacit acknowledgment that the song’s buoyant flair is tempered by a monolithic quality so immense it stops time (fittingly, the Mannequin Challenge helped the brothers overcome underperforming album sales and score their first #1 record). With the fatherly presence of Gucci Mane, hot off his rejuvenated life post-prison, the song crams as much joy into itself as possible, the two young rappers and their Atlanta dad trading bars, comparing themselves to the most hallowed group in rock history. Swae Lee, the same guy who penned the irresistible Beyoncé hook “OK ladies, now let’s get in formation,” turns a meme (“Get you somebody that can do both”) into a sweet croon. By the time Slim Jxmmi declares, “Me and Paul McCartney related!” near the end, this pair has efficiently turned the song’s simple conceptual gag into a reflection of their own songwriting prowess.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_9,2016,True Love Waits,Nathan Reese,"For the longest time, it seemed like “True Love Waits” would remain one of the great songs never put to tape in a studio. Originally written around the time of 1995’s The Bends, Radiohead have played it live for years, and its ever-evolving form—from a delicately strummed version to one made opaque by reverb—has been chronicled by bootleggers and fans along the way. Though the band did release an official, stripped-down concert recording of the song in 2001—which producer Nigel Godrich once called “that shitty live version”—the mystery remained. But then, 21 years after it first graced a stage, “True Love Waits” showed up to close A Moon Shaped Pool. Fans have speculated that Thom Yorke’s own broken heart resulted in this definitive take; it’s more cracked and brittle than any bootleg, with pianos that pull at the singer’s voice like spirits tugging at the corporeal world. Lines that once felt like a plea—“just don’t leave”—sound hopeless now, Yorke singing to his departed lover. Whatever the reason the band felt the song was finally ready, “True Love Waits” is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead’s most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic. The wait was worth it.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_8,2016,Shut Up Kiss Me,Quinn Moreland,"Angel Olsen opens My Woman with a dreamy prediction that she will “fall in love with you someday.” That haze is short-lived; when “Shut Up Kiss Me” rolls around a few minutes later, she’s suddenly full of determination. “Someday” now translates to “immediately.” There’s no time for debate in her demand to “shut up kiss me hold me tight.” My Woman’s most rockin’ number cuts straight to the point. Olsen is no stranger to frank expression, but the dogged determination of “Shut Up Kiss Me” shows off many new tools in her arsenal. After her initial attempts at reconciliation prove futile, Olsen pulls out her final tactic: throaty temptation. As she offers herself as a vessel for her lover’s anxieties (“I could make it all disappear/You could feed me all of your fears”), something within Olsen snaps, and the gravity of the situation is truly felt for the first time. In the song’s self-directed video, this moment is represented by Olsen being dragged away on her roller-skates until she falls to the ground, her voice spinning off-kilter until it dissolves past words. There’s no resolution here, but there’s also no doubt that Olsen will get back on her feet and keep trying.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_7,2016,Work,Noah Yoo,"It’s likely that the sweeping popularity of Rihanna’s “Work” led the way in a windfall of dancehall-inspired pop tunes throughout the year, from Tory Lanez’ “Luv” to Sia’s Sean Paul-featuring “Cheap Thrills,” bringing Caribbean riddims and vernacular to the top of the Billboard 100 for the first time in about a decade. (In a year where ethno-nationalism swept the United States, this feat proves Rihanna can be just as political as, say, the Knowles sisters.) Elsewhere in “Work,” Drake is at his earnest best, playing the emotional foil to Rihanna’s chorus while assuring her that he’d pick her over an equally hot, talented twin. The beat is magical and minimal, with Boi-1da leaving enough space to allow the two superstars to propel the song forward. In a year that gave us two AubRih songs (and plenty of relationship-status speculation), “Work” stands out in its urgent beauty.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_6,2016,Drone Bomb Me,Philip Sherburne,"At the center of Luigi Russolo’s 1913 manifesto “The Art of Noises” is a letter from his friend and fellow Futurist F.T. Marinetti. It is a punch-drunk, stream-of-consciousness string of gibberish meant to replicate the concussive tumble of trench warfare—a breathless, onomatopoeic blast of “zang-tumb-tuumb” climaxing in an “orchestra of the noises of war swelling under a held note of silence in the high sky.” A “held note of silence” isn’t a bad description for the way Anohni’s voice cuts through the rapid-fire chaos—the rat-a-tat drums, the martial fanfare—of Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never’s production in the devastating “Drone Bomb Me,” which she has described as a “love song” from the perspective of a 9-year-old Afghani girl whose family has just been killed by a drone strike. But when she sings “I want to die” in a voice so clear it could stop bullets in mid-air, she turns the Futurists’ macho posturing on its head. In place of noise, Anohni gives us a melody that’s almost unbearably gorgeous. In place of Marinetti’s lust for war and “scorn for woman,” she posits radical empathy—an empathy so extreme, in fact, that it may make you a little uncomfortable. “Blow my head off,” she sings, giving voice to the little girl’s extravagant death wish. “Explode my crystal guts/Lay my purple on the grass.”",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_5,2016,Lazarus,Sam Sodomsky,"There is no resurrection in “Lazarus.” The song arrives as a moment of tension: a lumbering melody tugged along by mournful saxophones and guitars that sound like heavy doors slamming shut. In it, our narrator finds himself in danger. He drops his cellphone and heads to New York City, desperation never too far behind. He has a fleeting vision of himself in the not-so-distant future: “I’ll be free, just like that bluebird.” After a chaotic squall—the kind of wild, jutting rhythm that Bowie used to ride toward the heavens—things abruptly fade, giving the song an eerie, elliptical end. In his last video, Bowie acts out that finale, looking terrified before flashing a sudden devilish smirk and retreating into the darkness. You forget for a second that he’s acting; then you remember he’s not.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_4,2016,Ivy,Jace Clayton,"“Oooh I could hate you now/It’s quite alright to hate me now,” sings Frank Ocean with all the tenderness in the world, “but we both know that deep down/The feeling still deep down is good.” A shimmery guitar intertwines with his voice, and the snake-space formed by their movement is mesmerizing. The only other musical element in this ballad of reflection and regret is a bassline whose understated propulsion allows for subtleties of timing that a rhythm section would deny. Love songs that trade in high-contrast emotions draped over straightforward song structures may be aspirational but they rarely ring true, which is why this love song stays with us, irrefutable and unexpected: “I had no chance to prepare/Couldn’t see you coming.” After climaxing with a scream, “Ivy” ends amid a scrabble of indeterminate noise. By including the sound of a song being abandoned, Ocean voices what every bruised lover knows: Messiness both fucks with grace and makes it possible.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_3,2016,Cranes in the Sky,Kevin Lozano,"“Cranes in the Sky” is a wondrously wrought song about emotional precarity and recovery. If the body and mind are some personal city unto itself, for Solange, the cranes looming above are powerful symbols of how omnipresent and ugly the work of self-care can be. With the help of Raphael Saadiq’s magnificently spacious production, she weaves together a series of defeats and diversions into some landscape of possible healing. It’s a small epic about coming to grips with yourself, framed as a deep, warm, musical embrace.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_2,2016,Formation,Britt Julious,"No one was quite prepared for Beyoncé’s “Formation.” The video dropped with little fanfare—just an unlisted link on her website during a Saturday afternoon in the dead of winter. But by the next day, when Bey appeared at the Super Bowl halftime show with Coldplay and Bruno Mars, a new era had dawned. Both song and video were defiant, proud, political: Beyoncé flicked off the camera, sprawled before us, drowning atop a police car. She was taking a stand for herself and for larger issues like Black Lives Matter and police brutality, no longer conforming to the structures around her. Mike WiLL Made-It’s production begins piercingly, with sparse trap beats rolling into a marching-band stomp. Spindly synths bubble below the surface, a complement to aggressive, proudly black lyrics: “I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils,” Bey sings at one point. Here, plainly and strongly, is a woman redefining her long-established role as an entertainer; a few months later, upon the release of Lemonade, we also learned that this was a woman advocating for the resiliency and internalized power of all black women in a world that denigrates our minds and bodies.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2016_1,2016,Ultralight Beam,Jayson Greene,"I’m tryna keep my faith. But I’m lookin’ for more. Kanye West has always stood before us a troubled, hungry soul, a Rorschach blot of desperation and exuberance. During his frantic, decade-long scramble to the pulsing center of pop culture, he has often seemed a man cursed by dissatisfaction, doomed to pull repeatedly from a thermos of salted water. It’s been hard not to wonder, whether you hated or loved him: What drives this guy? Can anyone keep this up? Somewhere I can feel safe. And end this holy war. As 2016 dawned uneasily, West seemed, for the first time, capable of succumbing to the exhaustion that was the flip side of his blazing creative energy. He was in the second half of his 30s; he’d had his second child; he was trying to corral an unruly mess of an album that seemed to keep defying basic order and structure. So he opened the album with a prayer. The song is at least 30 percent silence. Silence is not a common guest on Kanye West’s albums. Here, it is the star. Pray for Paris. Pray for the parents. “Ultralight Beam” is an exalted space, a promise of redemption and healing that felt more fragile and unlikely as the year wore on. It is a song of Godlike perspective from a man who spent most of the year appearing to have none. It’s a Kanye West song with almost no Kanye West in it. Oh, he is responsible for it—technically speaking, he is the reason that Kirk Franklin and Kelly Price are here, sharing space with The-Dream and Chance the Rapper; he’s the motivation behind this thumping, sleepy beat and those rafter-quaking gospel harmonies. But apart from dispensing some words of kindness and benediction, he barely appears. Whatever we are meant to experience inside of this little space, we need him out of the way. He seems to understand this. This is a God dream. This is everything. Not much felt safe or certain in 2016, the year of crumbling structures and looming threats realized. Humanity’s penchant for destroying itself, for tearing at societal bonds, took its raging turn in the spotlight. There was precious little empathy or palpable love to be found. We all seem exhausted. On November 22, West checked himself into a hospital, shortly after unraveling onstage, for “temporary psychosis due to sleep deprivation and dehydration.” He spent Thanksgiving there, canceling future tour dates. Weeks earlier, his wife had been held up at gunpoint in a brutal robbery. As the darkness closes in, “Ultralight Beam” pulses outward, neither dimming nor brightening as it offers its unchanging message: This is a God dream. This is everything. Everything.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2016,Pitchfork
2017_100,2017,On + Off,Zoe Camp,"As a humble music student from Maryland, Maggie Rogers rose to fame after catching Pharrell's ear with her enigmatic pop song “Alaska.” The upbeat electro track showcased Rogers’ keen intuition as a songwriter and arranger. Now “On + Off” finds her a brilliant alchemist, joining styles from across the sonic spectrum under a swooping arc. Brittle synth pop, heartland folk, quiet storm R&B, deep house, velvety dream pop, even a trace of gospel choir: They’re all here, in the brilliant stained glass mirror through which she sees the world. –Zoe Camp",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_99,2017,Build You Up,Zoe Camp,"Between signing with Interscope and landing a spot onXXL’s Freshmen class of ’17, Kamaiyah Johnson made plenty of power moves over the past 12 months. Her greatest may be “Build You Up,” a punchy neon pep talk that repurposes Tony! Toni! Toné!’s 1990 chart-topper “Feels Good” into a burst of R&B optimism. Kamaiyahhas saidshe wrote “Build You Up” to empower young women within a cultural landscape where such anthems are scarce. True enough, in her catchy track, the Bay Area MC lifts up her peers as she stresses their right to love and respect. “If he don’t show you love, then he’s less than/Never stress it, tell that brother get to steppin’,” she instructs. Words to live by. –Zoe Camp",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_98,2017,Percolator,Chris Randle,"The 2001 film version ofJosie and the Pussycatswas a commercial failure, but many of us grew to love its power-pop soundtrack anyway, and some even formed bands. Charly Bliss stand out among them by favoring pop over force: “Percolator” offers a few moments of grimy guitar before attacking the listener with hooks instead. Eva Hendricks’ voice has the capricious shape of an inner monologue, squeaking out each wry line: “Swimming in your pool, I am pregnant with meaning/Could I be more appealing, writing slurs on the ceiling?” It’s sardonic, self-deprecating, and utterly serious all at once. Satirizing the music industry as a psy-ops conspiracy,Josie and the Pussycatsalso suggested how much fear and disdain youthful ardor can provoke. Call it power—something “Percolator” has. –Chris Randle",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_97,2017,Wild Thoughts,Michelle Kim,"“Wild Thoughts” is proof that DJ Khaled’s sheer determination to engineer Top 40 hits can actually pay off. Strategic in his appeals to nostalgia, Khaled essentially recreated Santana and the Product G&B’s 1999 hit “Maria Maria,” retaining its shuffling Latin percussion and seductive guitar lines. Perhaps Khaled knew a Latin-tinged pop song could rule the U.S. charts for the summer—but only if an English-speaking superstar jumped on it, as evidenced by Justin Bieber’s remix of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito.” After eight years of trying to get Rihanna on a track, Khaled finally landed an elusive feature, and her ability to exude carefree sex appeal proved a perfect match for the slinky beat. Confident and restrained, Rihanna dips to the lowest parts of her range to make playful phrases about temptation sound as sensuous as possible. Bryson Tiller contributes a just-fine verse that expectedly mentions D’usse and not-so-expectedly referencesThe Waterboy. Add in the occasional over-exuberant ad-lib from DJ Khaled, and you have the recipe for a great summer bop. –Michelle Kim",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_96,2017,Rake It Up,Kristin Corry,"For decades, strip clubs in the South have served as a testing ground for hip-hop songs, and Yo Gotti handcrafted “Rake It Up” as a pole-friendly anthem. But instead of the usual “make it rain” tropes centered around the power of the patron, the Memphis rapper shifts the energy to the dancers raking up wads of cash after a successful night on the job. Producer Mike WiLL Made-It finesses hi-hats and big bass into a spacious beat that’s filled out by Gotti and Nicki Minaj, who makes rhyming the word “China” five times in a row sound ingenious on one of her most showstopping features in recent memory. Here, the women are moneymakers, and Nicki is center stage. –Kristin Corry",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_95,2017,A Wall,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Earlier this year, as the White House bungled the implementation of its “Muslim ban,” sparking airport protests and civil rights lawsuits, Downtown Boys were holed up in Steve Albini’s Chicago studio cutting their Sub Pop debut,Cost of Living. Vocalist Victoria Ruiz and guitarist Joey DeFrancesco earned their activist stripes organizing for labor and civil rights in their home base of Providence, Rhode Island; they’re not used to watching from the sidelines. But the record they cut will endure long after the current administration has left office, and “A Wall,” its opening salvo, perfectly captures their righteous rage. In between the driving bassline and soaring sax melody, Ruiz and DeFrancesco shout down jingoistic imperialism. It’s an extension of the band’s live shows, which are equal parts dance party and discourse. Ruiz confronts and challenges her audience, encouraging us to decolonize our minds while examining our own complicity in oppressive structures rooted in white supremacy. On a record full of defiant statements, “A Wall” is among the most forceful. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_94,2017,The Embers,Marc Hogan,"Lætitia Tamko never says anything about fire on “The Embers,” the opening track of Vagabon’s debut album,Infinite Worlds. In a rougher version, at the end of Vagabon’s 2014 EPPersian Garden, the same song was titled “Sharks.” You could argue the original title made more sense, because Tamko sings here—laconically, unforgettably—about being “a small fish” in a sea of voracious predators. But “The Embers” fans her artistic statement of self-belief into a glowing, quiet-loud opus that evokes both classic Modest Mouse and recent Hop Along. It’s proof that there are other seas for small fish, particularly the New York D.I.Y. community that nurtured Vagabon. And yet, in showing how someone made to feel marginal can transform that sense of vulnerability into strength, the song also reveals determined souls can set any situation brilliantly ablaze. –Marc Hogan",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_93,2017,Man’s Not Hot,Andrew Gaerig,"It was a banner year for grime-related humor, first seeingRoll Safeachievememe-levelfame, and then Big Shaq’s “Man’s Not Hot” proving itself the most quotable British product since Lethal Bizzle’s “Rari Workout.” Casual observers might wonder if grime parodies are better than grime tracks, but “Man’s Not Hot” renders that distinction moot by being an excellent example of each. Indeed, it joins in a tradition of songs (e.g., the Darkness’ “I Believe in a Thing Called Love”) that so expertly lampoon their chosen genre they become part of its firmament. “Man’s Not Hot,” which originated as afreestyle on BBC Radio 1Xtra, is the brainchild of British comedian Michael Dapaah, who builds the track around one wry observation—why are young toughs always mugging in parkas?—and withholds the punch line long enough to practice his gun noises and turn “donut” into an insult. He also brags about his deodorant and ups the stakes (“Man can never be hot/Perspiration ting”), wrapping the track so tightly in patois and bravado that it hardly matters whether you’re doubled over laughing or marring your search history with “uckers.” –Andrew Gaerig",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_92,2017,Midnight,Briana Younger,"“Midnight” is the sound of walls tumbling down, the kinds used to shield a heart from love. Upon its release, Jessie Ware described the song as one she’s “always wanted to be able to sing” and it exudes a newfound confidence, shining with every note. Ware sounds powerful and poised as she embodies the full force of falling for someone. “Can I miss you in the daylight?” she sings, underscoring the question’s idyllic naivety. But for all the vulnerability contained within these lyrics, Ware’s vocals are the grandest revelation here, capturing the beautiful discomfort of such a feeling. She employs her higher register to stunning effect, and this iteration of old soul-tinged pop is Ware at her most impressive. –Briana Younger",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_91,2017,The One to Wait,Andrew Gaerig,"“The One to Wait” begins quietly, with a wash of guitar and a gentle breakbeat. And then Mary Jane Dunphe, a singer who always sounds like she’s announcing herself to the world, announces herself to the world, and CCFX sounds for a moment like the type of brilliant post-punk act that arrives like a summer storm to reorganize your thoughts about rock music. The end result isn’t quite so dramatic, thankfully. CCFX is Dunphe’s collaboration with Trans FX’s Chris McDonnell, and the dream pop they conjure is the most luxurious environ she's inhabited yet. On “The One to Wait,” her voice swoops and eddies through a tale of longing and indecision, her phrasing and tone almost sculpture-like in its exaggerated poses. The lyrics and puddled guitars suggest sadness, but the song’s melody seems to slope ever upward, never quite cresting. It creates a fidgety, nervous energy that carries the track as you wonder if Dunphe is going to let loose. She doesn’t, because some storms just drizzle all day long. –Andrew Gaerig",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_90,2017,Mi Gente  (Remix),Alex Frank,"It is a strange sign of the times that after a hurricane struck Houston in late summer, there was a faction of the internet mad at Beyoncé for not responding quickly enough to help her hometown, as though she were a public servant or president (oh were it so!) and not a Pepsi-sponsored pop star. Of course, Beyoncé always answers her detractors with statements so powerful, no further comment is needed—and so, not only did she personally go to Houston herself to hand out food to those in need, she later dropped a remix of Colombian singer J Balvin’s massive Latin hit “Mi Gente” to benefit hurricane relief all around the hemisphere in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and Mexico. Balvin is about as big as B in Latin America, and his track was already massive globally without her help. But the Beyoncé charity co-sign put reggaeton on the speakers of kids in America who might never have heard it before, and made her as effective—if not more—at helping to fix the world’s ills than some actual heads of state who shall remain nameless. –Alex Frank",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_89,2017,Little Bubble,Jesse Jarnow,"Camouflaged as a breakup album, Dirty Projectors’ self-titled, eighth full-length was a reinvention for songwriter Dave Longstreth, and nowhere more so than on the empty-bed lament “Little Bubble.” Featuring Longstreth, a string quartet, and a heroically minimalist drum part by Michael Johnson, “Little Bubble” bypasses the deeply specific references that dot many of the album’s songs and aims for something more universal, straightforward, and ambitious. The self-harmonized verses take about half the song’s length to achieve its central, sad thought. En route, Longstreth finds a new mode for his nearly decade-and-a-half old project via a gently glitching keyboard, barely perceptible bubble-shaped bleeps, and the barest of rhythm tracks. The moody dynamic, casting the music with the song’s “cold October light,” frames his R&B vocal tendencies in a way both legitimately poppy and true to his weirdness. Downsized but still intricate, Longstreth’s return to mostly-solo recording manifests as self-resolution on “Little Bubble,” pointing to a future with new paths to discover, but no less filled with loss. –Jesse Jarnow",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_88,2017,Pa’lante,Marc Hogan,"The phrase “pa’lante,” meaning “forward,” was a rallying cry for the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican civil rights group that took to the streets of Spanish Harlem in the late 1960s. On Hurray for the Riff Raff’s albumThe Navigator, leader Alynda Segarra makes “Pa’lante” into a powerful ode to perseverance. Starkly swaying piano chords meet Segarra’s raw-throated musings about work, romance, gender identity, and, yes, post-colonial assimilation. There’s a brightly affirmative midsection (“Any day now, I will come along,” Segarra promises) and a searing poetry reading before the itinerant Nuyorican folk-rock bandleader widens her gaze further “to the ghost of Emmett Till” and beyond. In a year of Hurricane Maria, of tragic headlines for so many who were historically marginalized, Segarra’s repetition of “pa’lante” sounds like an intersectional “amen”: a universal prayer to be something, feel something, move forward. –Marc Hogan",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_87,2017,Sign of the Times,Stacey Anderson,"The saddest shift of youth arrives the day your favorite tousle-haired boy-bander leaves your daydreams and abruptly needs to get off your lawn. More depressing still are the stabs at trendiness that eclipsed teen heartthrobs often take: mealy-mouthed EDM sex ballads, hammy Broadway residencies, Xeroxed pop-soul trifles. Harry Styles was one of the rare ones who hopscotched neatly over all these awkward phases once One Direction went on hiatus. Instead, on his debut solo single, “Sign of the Times,” Styles embraced the musical forms that his peers might deem uncool, from Elton John ivories-melting pomp to Glen Campbell–style lurid balladry. Grim lyrics that could seem fatalist (or given his age, just a bit emo) are delivered with earthy insight, Styles showing his true crooner abilities as he warns of bleak times to come. Well, maybe for everyone else—this golden child seems to have blue skies ahead. –Stacey Anderson",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_86,2017,Dream Daddy,Evan Minsker,"“Dream Daddy” was not presented to the world as Baths’ new masterwork. There was no PR blast announcing its arrival, and it can’t be purchased on vinyl like his impressive new album,Romaplasm. It lives primarily as the opening title music for its video game namesake, and although the 96-second song’s primary function is to transition us into a world of scrumptious virtual DILFs, it’s so much more than a throwaway sonic blurb. Will Wiesenfeld weaves an earworm for the ages, a melody so beatific that the term “dream daddy” transcends its meme status and becomes a universal idyll. With only a handful of words and some celestial vocal effects, he paints an impressionistic portrait of fresh crush elation. The beat makes it danceable and heightens the euphoria—a mood that’s easy to consume again and again, making it perfect for pre-game repetition. Maybe one day, it’ll get a good, long 12'' dance mix—but until then, that title screen will just have to stay on repeat, postponing gameplay indefinitely. –Evan Minsker",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_85,2017,I’m Better,Cameron Cook,"It’s been a staggering 12 years since Missy Elliott, still the grande dame of hip-hop, released her last studio album. As such, any morsel of music she releases is a blessing, and for the past few years, she has been slowly but surely teasing a full-blown comeback. So far, the syrupy-slow “I’m Better” is the apex of these new tracks, and one that is quintessentially Missy: a lean, funky beat coupled with mind-bending wordplay in her iconic half-bar drawl. The song shows a subdued maturity that separates it from the classic Missy tracks we know and love, without holding back on her sense of innovation. Before, Missy was eager to show us the impressive range of tricks in her arsenal, from groundbreaking production work with Timbaland to her legendary music videos. Here, she’s more thoughtful and controlled, but just as impactful, and her lyrics just as witty (somehow managing to rhyme “I’m from VA” with “the car that I drive be Ferrari”). The core tenets of Missy’s persona—body positivity, black female empowerment, Afrofuturism—have only become more prescient with time, and while awaiting her true second coming, she is still demanding we get our freak on—but on her terms, and in her own time. –Cameron Cook",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_84,2017,Hug of Thunder,Ryan Dombal,"Looking back at a scribbly teenage journal, decades later, can be bittersweet: Here is, word for word, who you were and will never be again, all rendered in the glorious freedom of youth. For her first star turn on a Broken Social Scene song in 11 years, Leslie Feist revisits her own adolescent musings—the Syd Barrett surrealism, the broken teeth, the days when “the bus stop was the size of the entire world”—with a sense of awe. This isn’t nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake; there are layers of remembrance, half-memories, creases made up of meaning. Lilting through her past over a gently surging backbeat, she fills “Hug of Thunder” with the wisdom of a sentimentalist. Each line, old and new, is memorable enough to feel real, with blank pages to spare. –Ryan Dombal",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_83,2017,Location,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Playboi Carti’s self-titled breakthrough album is best known for charismatic singles like “Magnolia” and “wokeuplikethis*”—songs that sharpen the Atlanta rapper’s hypnotic languor into trunk-rattling bangers. But in many ways, album opener “Location” is more true to form, a mood piece that’s equal parts triumphant and narcotic. The song is built around a sample of Allan Holdsworth’s jazz fusion classic “Endomorph,” which producer Harry Fraud treats like Silly Putty, pitching it up and slowing it down until the soaring synths become smears of sound. Carti matches Fraud’s impressionistic beat with a heavy-lidded, laconic flow, rapping like he’s being taxed per word. His bars are snapshots that slowly dissolve through repetition, just another texture in the neon haze. Like all of Playboi Carti’s best songs, “Location” is an exercise in economy, a vivid picture painted using a limited palette of colors. –Mehan Jayasuriya",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_82,2017,Siphon,Marc Masters,"The songs on Zola Jesus’sOkovicontain a lot of straight talk, and “Siphon” is one of its bluntest. Writing about a real-life friend’s second attempt at suicide, Nika Danilova avoids couching the event in metaphor or stand-in characters. Instead, she talks directly to her friend, insisting that everyone wants him to stay alive and will do everything they can to make sure that happens. Such earnest lyrics, filled with references to dark nights and warm blood, could venture into sentimental cliches. But the boldness of Danilova’s vocal delivery, the gathering storm of her synths, and the hard industrial pound of her beat give “Siphon” the urgent sonic edge its words deserve. Danilova sounds sure that matters of life and death deserve direct action, and that conviction makes “Siphon” sound like a siren blaring toward an emergency. –Marc Masters",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_81,2017,The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness,Grayson Haver Currin,"The National don’t do guitar solos. Across the band’s first six albums, they favored an inward emotional gaze, a reflective austerity that limits such sudden, shrieking outbursts. But halfway into “The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness,” guitarist Aaron Dessner rushes in to relieve Matt Berninger, who’s so vexed by the world around him that he can only shout out his confusion on repeat, his steadfast baritone splintering at its oaken edges. Dessner dives headlong into the bridge, bending the song’s snarling lead riff with the rhythmic acrobatics of Robbie Robertson and the irascible tone of Neil Young. Berninger inveighs against something he can’t quite define here, a world of inadequate faiths, power vacuums, and “lonely secrets.” Dessner’s star turn, though, puts a knife point on this frustration, weaponizing the song. Guitar solos work like curses; overuse them and they lose their rhetorical power. The National smartly saved this—a bona fide rock’n’roll rip through time—for an anthem that admits even trying to articulate the mess we’re in can be goddamn tiring. –Grayson Haver Currin",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_80,2017,Quarrel,Olivia Horn,"Moses Sumney hassaidthat his songs tend to hover somewhere in the interstice between sleeping and waking. The cinematic harp rolls and floating vocal embellishments that outfit “Quarrel,” from his debut album,Aromanticism, certainly seem like snippets of dream language written into reality. Sumney could be speaking from within the kind of early-morning fog that lets dreams linger, clouding out everything but personal truth from the subconscious mind—which would explain his brutal honesty in addressing the emotional distance between him and his lover. After singing most of “Quarrel” in an icy falsetto, Sumney slips into a lower, more conversational register to deliver its stinging final couplet: “We cannot be lovers/Long as I’m the other.” He’s referring to the implicit power dynamics that wreak havoc on relationships—from class disparities to less obvious differences, like preference of attachment type—and make it impossible for lovers to negotiate as equals, dooming their prospects from the start. His cynicism could rattle the most die-hard romantic. –Olivia Horn",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_79,2017,He Is the Voice I Hear,Nate Patrin,"In the handwritten liner notes to this single by Marea Stamper, aka the Black Madonna, the “He” in the title is legendary Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan, answering a prayer by the “I” that was the equally iconic Frankie Knuckles. Stamper adds more names to shout out—Arthur Russell, Patrick Cowley, Sylvester, Loleatta Holloway—and underscores the tribute in the structure of the song, which starts with the ghost-jazz piano of Christoforo Labarbera and builds from its mournful intro into a string-sweetened old-school Moroder pulse that blurs history into a cyclical continuum of euphoric remembrance. Gripes about “pastiche” miss the point. You can hear snatches of ’74 soul or ’79 Italo or ’85 house or ’88 acid in certain rhythms and chord progressions, but it’s all refracted into a greater whole, where the most important history is emotional. It’s ultimately about all the connections that people make through decades of music, of finding a path to old feelings and remembering how your heart connects to your feet. –Nate Patrin",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_78,2017,On Hold,Evan Rytlewski,"The typical xx song plays like a conversation between best friends—lovers, if you use your imagination—confiding their innermost secrets to each other. That intimacy among singers Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim casts a powerful spell, but it can also leave producer Jamie xx in a tough spot, like a guy trying to lure his friends onto the dancefloor while they stubbornly insist on standing in the corner. On the group’s previous albums, Jamie’s overtures usually amounted to a gentle tug on the sleeve, but “On Hold”—the first taste ofI See You— marks the moment he finally just grabs his bandmates by the arms and pushes them under the bright lights. Powered by a strobe-lit bass and a showy Hall & Oates sample, the song forces Madley Croft and Sim to relinquish the comfort of their insular safe spaces and hash out their issues as if yelling over a neighbor’s car stereo. It’s a therapeutic exercise that draws their pent-up feelings to the surface, an emotional cleansing by way of the beat. –Evan Rytlewski",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_77,2017,Big for Your Boots,Laura Snapes,"Hands down the best childhood sound is that winded, rubbery “OOEEHH” gasp that comes in the wake of a cheap plastic soccer ball being thwacked across a field. By some feat of vocal magic, grime ambassador Stormzy captures that exact noise every time he repeats the word “boots” on this song about kicking down pretenders. It is incredibly satisfying. “Big for Your Boots” is regal, gothic, brutally cheeky, dexterous, and utterly assured: Stormzy can pull off schooling wannabe bad boysandnicking meat out of his mum’s stew pot in a single breath. The song tethers the pitched-up vocal samples of grime’s past to a pop present where its creators no longer have to compromise to break the mainstream in their native UK. Because, finally, they are the mainstream. –Laura Snapes",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_76,2017,Anxi,Claire Lobenfeld,"There was a strong current of techno-feminism flowing throughout 2017, from UMFANG’s playful, scrappySymbolic Use of Lightto Kelly Lee Owens’ meditative self-titled debut. Owens’ album reminds us that techno doesn’t always have to be stark or severe, and she makes the best use of her gentle touch on “Anxi.” The track coaxes you into its orbit with delicate, reverberating percussion before guest artist Jenny Hval and her lullaby-like vocals meet sunny synths—it is both a restorative balm and minimalist mover. But a deeper listen proves to be less light: “Always failed at the romantic/I did baroque badly,” Hval sings, with her characteristically calm caution, as the brightness subsides and coldness sets in. It is a somber reminder that things aren’t always what they seem or what we want them to be; that tranquil places can still be disrupted by our own muddy minds. –Claire Lobenfeld",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_75,2017,Bank Account,Paul A. Thompson,"Until this year, 21 Savage had succeeded mostly as a specialist, someone whose thin, sneering deadpan was best suited to short bursts over Metro Boomin’s sparsest, most ambient production.Issa Albumrevealed the Atlantan as something more, someone capable of mining rote consumption or clawing survival to find its psychological crevices. That album’s breakout hit, “Bank Account,” which 21 produced, gives trips to the mall and to Wells Fargo a crushing weight, like 21 is going to buckle under all those millions. He’s become a deceptively slippery vocalist, sliding in and out of cadences that have dominated Atlanta rap for last half-decade, leveraging a limited vocal range for maximum effect. There’s also a delightful absurdity to how specific the references get: at times, 21 references a character from the movieShottasand warns that “the Draco make you do the chickenhead like Chingy.” It’s grim and impossibly fun. –Paul A. Thompson",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_74,2017,Pull Up Wit Ah Stick,Obbo,"It’s fun now to think about how the simplest of melodies changed SahBabii’s life, but the Atlanta rookie once considered the catchy riff on “Pull Up Wit Ah Stick” too basic to be released. Recorded in his brother’s bedroom using a broken microphone, his breakout track narrowly made the cut for hisS.A.N.D.A.S.mixtape last year; after snippets of the song went viral online, Young Thug hopped on the remix this summer. Throughout “Pull Up Wit Ah Stick,” SahBabii and Loso Loaded make multiple references to firearms—“Draco with a drum” and, of course, “a stick”—without once using the most colloquial terms. The song’s controversial andincredibly popular videofeatures an unholy amount of weaponry, and is thus more direct in its messaging—but even without it, the track scores as both a street anthem and an irrepressible shot of confidence. With this song blaring, anyone can pull up to the function and feel like the most important person there. –Vanessa Okoth-Obbo",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_73,2017,Bobby,Alex Frank,"“Bobby” is not the first song that (Sandy) Alex G has quite longingly named for a boy, but it’s so lovely and lovesick that it’s the one you’re likely to return to when your next relationship rips apart and you’re left all alone. Alex had been better known for a sound that pulled from emo and indie, but on his 2017 album,Rocket, he was seemingly inspired by one of his heroes, Lucinda Williams, to make work that sounds almost Appalachian at times. With violin and lazy guitar, “Bobby” is a worn-out country duet between him and frequent collaborator Emily Yacina, her voice soaring when his collapses. Alex’s talent has always been an almost adolescent capacity for wonder and intimacy, and this song is either a tender tale about a bisexual love triangle or a metaphoric marvel in which he personifies his own crippling self-doubt as a kid named Bobby. The subject maybe doesn’t matter: His voice crackles with feeling, as though he had picked his bruised self off the floor and struggled through the words with tearstained cheeks and clenched fists. You could say you hear his heart breaking right there in the music, but “Bobby” is so powerful, it might just be your own. –Alex Frank",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_72,2017,Want You Back,Olivia Horn,"Listening to a Haim song is kind of like getting a disjointed lesson in contemporary music history. In their distinct strain of left-of-center pop, sisters Danielle, Alana, and Este simultaneously revere disparate genres through their ages, from soft-focus ’70s rock to doo-wop group vocals to thoroughly of-the-moment pop tropes. Delivered a week after afakeoutof a lead single, “Want You Back” was the first proper taste of the trio’s second album,Something to Tell You. True to form, it compiles a playful assortment of sounds: power ballad–worthy piano chords, pitch-shifted vocal riffs, and what sounds like a horse neigh. Within the space of two lines in the chorus (“I’ll take the fall and the fault in us/I’ll give you all the love I never gave before I left you”), Danielle achieves a rhythmic flow that simultaneously flexes her strengths as a lyricist, vocalist, and percussionist. That dexterity, paired with a healthy dose of idiosyncrasy, had us singing the chorus right back at Haim. –Olivia Horn",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_71,2017,Die 4 You,Seth Colter Walls,"The precision of Mike Hadreas’ singing is a perfect fit for balladry. But the invention of his songwriting often makes for surprises that are even more affecting. Here, during the mournful, rubato feel of the opening verse, you may wonder about hisdescriptionof this tune as a “love song” (even if the breathy singing style delivers lyrics that referenceerotic asphyxiation). Yet the underlying aim is unmissable by the song’s hinge point. As one conflicted couplet—“Each and every breath I spend/You are collecting”—is cut off, unfinished, the composition moves to a new melodic line, driven with mid-tempo swagger. When Hadreas sings “Oh my love, take your time,” the song’s new air of pleasure has all the license it needs to stick around for the remainder of the track. –Seth Colter Walls",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_70,2017,Did You See,Paul A. Thompson,"East London rapper J Hus’Common Senseis an album that sidesteps another false start of an American grime crossover, preferring to survey everything from Afrobeats to turn-of-the-century Roc-A-Fella instead. Its lead single, “Did You See,” starts off like so many radio pop songs from the last handful of years: delicately, with a sound palette imported from West Africa. Throughout the track, Hus stays in a comfortable pocket, showing off his skills as an evocative and often hilarious writer: At one point, after comparing his changing cars to a magic trick, he remarks that the girls in the club have never seen such a skinny guy in such a big puffer jacket. –Paul A. Thompson",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_69,2017,Only Once Away My Son,Jesse Jarnow,"Since commissioning avant-garde guitarist Sonny Sharrock to write the theme song for “Space Ghost Coast to Coast” in 1993, Cartoon Network has occasionally served as an unlikely patron of experimental music. And this track from the Adult Swim Singles Series plays like a cartoon superhero reboot with the unexpected, fully welcome, and deliriously successful pairing of professional ex-glam sound genius Brian Eno and his new sidekick, My Bloody Valentine noise sculptor Kevin Shields. Begging to be listened to on noise-canceling headphones or very, very loud speakers, the duo blast off with a drum track that is instantly, almost comically subsumed into a nine-minute sound-cleanse of bells, drones, and a soaring rocket flare thatmaybe a guitar. Ambient but hardly static, its tones and textures return throughout, as if tracing long and inaudibly developing melodies. Not immediately identifiable as either Eno or Shields’ work, “Only Once Away My Son” is a rich, enveloping piece of music—and the cartoon superhero franchise we never knew we needed. –Jesse Jarnow",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_68,2017,The Pure and the Damned,Andy Beta,"At the end of the tightly wound modern noirGood Time, the film’s metallic score melts away as sumptuous piano chords begin to rumble, a moment of clarity finally washing over the film. Then Iggy Pop utters the word “love,” and the elegiac “The Pure and the Damned” blooms in full. “Every day I think about untwisting and untangling these strings I’m in/And to lead a pure life,” he confesses in a croon that brings to mind Ian Curtis’ wistful delivery on Joy Division’s “Atmosphere.” He’s singing of that foolhardy quest to turn the turbid reality of our world into something exquisite, giving voice to that all-too-human notion where, in the face of imminent doom, we still somehow hope for the ideal. –Andy Beta",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_67,2017,GUMMY,Michelle Kim,"The opening track of BROCKHAMPTON’sSaturation IIsounds like a combination of the young rap collective’s favorite turn-of-the-millennium artists, calling to mind the Neptunes’ off-kilter production, Timbaland’s affinity for Eastern melodies, and M.I.A.’s brash attitude. Despite the mélange of influences, each member that appears on “GUMMY” offers a distinct verse that stands out from the others—and saves BROCKHAMPTON from being dismissed as mere copycats. De facto leader Kevin Abstract sounds incredulous, gasping for air; Merlyn rages in a short and effective post-hook section; Ameer Vann contributes his laid-back Houston flow. With each new track, BROCKHAMPTON seem to be getting more daring, more willing to experiment with vocal deliveries, and just smarter. As individual personalities emerge, BROCKHAMPTON continue to build their own identity. It’s thrilling to watch. –Michelle Kim",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_66,2017,BagBak,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Vince Staples recently—and possibly, facetiously—maintainedthat his second studio album,Big Fish Theory, should be awarded the Grammy for electronic album of the year. It’s not an entirely silly thought. Trading in the swampy sonics of his debut for brighter hues and faster tempos,Big Fish Theoryfinds the Long Beach rapper taking a hard left into club music. It still bears his fingerprints, though, especially in its lead single, “BagBak.” Here, atop synth arpeggios and an aqueous bassline, Staples offers sharp stream-of-consciousness insights on sex, justice, race, and power—all converging in the moment he insists, “We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office.” When his frustration finally boils over, Staples’ directive for his president, the government, and the one percent to all “suck a dick” feels less like a sophomoric taunt and more like a protest chant: heartfelt, direct, cathartic. –Mehan Jayasuriya",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_65,2017,Need to Feel Your Love,Stuart Berman,"When we first encounter Tina Halladay on Sheer Mag’s debut full-length,Need to Feel Your Love, she’s taking to the streets on Inauguration Day with “bottles and bricks.” Then, a few tracks later, she’s upgraded her anarchist tool of choice tobayonets. But en route, the singer tiptoes out of the protest and dips into a basement disco to recharge her batteries and remember who and what she’s fighting for. With its gleaming, glitter-balled jangle, ghetto-blaster groove, and VHS-tape patina,Need to Feel Your Love’s title track doesn’t just introduce a dramatic change of scene for the Philly raunch-rock rebels; it’s a disarming expression of desire and vulnerability from a band that normally exudes swagger and fury. It’s also a necessary reminder that romantic surrender and organized resistance are two sides of the same burning heart. –Stuart Berman",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_64,2017,Golden Cage’’,Kevin Lozano,"It only happens a few times during the year in music, and sometimes it doesn’t happen at all. We wait for a song from some total newcomer that just wrecks you, grabs you by the lapel, and beckons you to listen over and over again. “Golden Cage,” by Nilüfer Yanya, is one of those songs. At 22, Yanya has the nonchalant vocal prowess of Amy Winehouse singing over a King Krule-style jazz-pop beat. And “Golden Cage” is an attractive blend of jagged guitar riffs and blasts of saxophone bliss played by Yanya’s friend, the amazingly named Jazzi Bobbi. It all comes together on a track that’s effortlessly cool, infinitely playable, and too special to sleep on. –Kevin Lozano",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_63,2017,Turn Out the Lights,Evan Rytlewski,"Loneliness isn’t just an emotion—it’s a physical sensation, often a debilitating one, and nobody captures it quite like Julien Baker. The title track from the songwriter’s aching second album finds her once again feeling numbed and powerless, almost paralyzed by the bum hand the world has dealt her. There she is, staring at a hole in the drywall she’ll probably never fix, trying to convince herself she prefers it that way. But “Turn Out the Lights” ends with a twinge of hope, building to a rare eruption of sound. At that moment, it’s as if a stray twinkle of her guitar connects with an open gas line, setting off a combustion that engulfs the song and shakes her from her funk. Nothing’s solved, of course—she’s still terrified of being alone—but she sounds determined to do something about it. She’s still got some fight left. –Evan Rytlewski",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_62,2017,Unforgettable,Cameron Cook,"After two albums and a walloping 22 mixtapes, it seems like French Montana is finally coming into his own. He’s always had the makings of a pop-rap icon, from his litany of exotically-set music videos and his heavily documented lavish lifestyle. Too often, though, his musical output has paled next to his Versace-bathrobe-and-Gucci-flip-flops persona, but that trend ostensibly ends with “Unforgettable,” an ultra-catchy, radio-friendly track that features an arresting turn from Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee. Amid rolling waves of steel drums, Lee’s vocals sound murkily echoed, as if he’s delivering his lines from right under the surface of his and Montana’s aqua green swimming pool. In contrast, French sounds fresh and crisp, riding a reggaeton beat around atmospheric keyboard swells. Reportedly, the rapper was so confident that “Unforgettable” would be a hit that he paid $300,000 out-of-pocket to clear the rights to the song, which started off as a demo by Jeremih. Evidently, his intuition paid off, and “Unforgettable” may very well mark the moment he became an altogether different kind of artist. –Cameron Cook",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_61,2017,123’’,Ian Cohen,"Girlpool rose to acclaim making anthems that weren’t particularlyanthemic—no swollen guitars, no reverbed drum rolls, no broad lyrics. And this track seemingly continues that trend as it starts off with Cleo Tucker and Harmony Tividad whispering over viscous guitar. But then big guitars, bigger drums, and full-throated vocals crash the quiet. Their (and our) world’s gotten a lot louder in the two years since their debut, and this song goes big to meet the surrounding noise. The emotions are still ambiguous, but they’re now rendered all-consuming, like a giant, bolded question mark. –Ian Cohen",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_60,2017,Marilyn,Andy Beta,"Squalls of punk noise, industrial haze, and churning rhythms jut up throughout Mount Kimbie’s third album, Love What Survives, but “Marilyn,” the record’s most hushed song, resonates the loudest. Recalling the gentler moments of post-punk icons like This Heat and the Raincoats, the UK duo bring a filigree of thumb piano and buzzing melodica to flutter around the track. Alongside them, Micachu and the Shapes’ Mica Levi provides the song’s murmuring heart with disorienting lines that ultimately reveal a quiet, secret space shared by two people. –Andy Beta",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_59,2017,Natural Blue,Sam Sodomsky,"“Been a long time since I’ve been moved,” Julie Byrne sings in “Natural Blue,” the slow, captivating centerpiece of her breakthrough album,Not Even Happiness. It’s a disquieting realization in a song about touring life—an existence shifting between thoughts, moods, and state lines. But “Natural Blue” doesn’t wallow; it arrives in a clear-eyed moment of understanding. The title could be read as a commentary on accepting one’s emotions, though Byrne doesn’t focus too long on her own state of mind. Her thoughts wander to the world around her until she’s left speechless, expressing wordless gratitude for the intangible things that hang above us, wherever we go. –Sam Sodomsky",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_58,2017,LOYALTY.,Grayson Haver Currin,"The moment Kendrick Lamar heard the sample that became the backbone of “LOYALTY.”—a warped, reversed sliver of Bruno Mars’ “24K Magic”—he made a declaration: He needed Rihanna in the studio. Perhaps it was the sample’s high-pitched whinny, strangely suggestive of Rihanna’s most languid hooks, that inspired his decision. Or maybe it was the stuttering drums, so suited to her seemingly effortless melismas. But on their first collaboration, the duo’s voices become lock-and-key, tongue-and-groove, perfect complements for a casual chorus with an ironclad grip. Rihanna and Kendrick don’t tell us what kind of loyalty to have, making no judgments on whether romantic, communal, or material faithfulness is best; having risen through hip-hop’s ranks, they simply celebrate the virtue itself, of maintaining relationships and prerogatives that existed before superstardom. Indeed, “LOYALTY.” feels like an unearthed gem from the heyday of Timbaland or Jermaine Dupri, with a high-end music video of fast cars and special effects to boot. It puts two of the world’s biggest stars in conversation; their fun sounds natural, their chemistry real, their loyalty earned. –Grayson Haver Currin",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_57,2017,Total Entertainment Forever,Stuart Berman,"Technology promises us so much: efficiency, independence, enlightenment. But in the end, it’s most reliable function has been to facilitate the cheap and plentiful distribution of pornography. According to Father John Misty, it won’t be long before we’re all strapping on headsets to enjoy a little virtual hoo-hah with our favorite pop stars after supper, just as we once congregated around the TV on Thursdays to watch “Friends.” But “Total Entertainment Forever” is more than just a cheeky commentary on the disassociating effects of our wired world: It’s a postmortem on the entire history of human civilization and a despairing indictment of a society in which the pinnacle of progress is a guy sitting in an easy chair, wearing robot goggles, and jerking off. We’ve spent an inordinate amount of time this past year worrying about whether the president’s next tweet will trigger World War III, but “Total Entertainment Forever” reassures us that we’re already well on our way to the apocalypse, and it won’t be the bombs that do us in. –Stuart Berman",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_56,2017,Czech One,Eric Torres,"“Czech One” operates within its own dream logic. Filled with eerie, screwed-down voices, subterranean beats, and distant keyboard lines, the song was inspired by Archy Marshall’s Eastern European ancestry as well as a trippydream sequencefrom “The Sopranos,” from which he also pulls an errant line of dialogue. Amid this woolgathering, Marshall packs his production with plenty of negative space in order to explore his thoughts. His King Krule project has always seemed to have a striking self-awareness to it, but on “Czech One,” Marshall gives that same insight a new, gripping dose of strangeness. –Eric Torres",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_55,2017,Planet’’,Thea Ballard,"Four Tet’s ninth album,New Energy, is shot through with a gossamer optimism, making it a dance-music outlier in a year understandably lacking in high spirits. But Kieran Hebden’s hopefulness is carefully measured, and in keeping with this tone, standout “Planet” concludes the album on an even keel, but also with arresting intricacy. Atop a familiar 4/4 beat, samples are layered one-by-one: a four-note bell melody, a breathy female coo, and then the bright, classical finger-picking that ultimately defines the melody. He surfs smoothly between analog and digital, and while it seems like he’s barely doing anything to meld these elements, they cohere in a lovely textural harmony. Noted for his slippery moves between electronic styles genres, Hebden asserts a streamlined language that’s distinctly his own. “Planet” is a gentle escape, but to a place that’s not altogether implausible. –Thea Ballard",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_54,2017,An Intention,Marc Masters,"The music of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith has always felt interlocked with nature, evolving like plants that sprout up and curl back into the ground. The Kid is her most elemental album to date, filled with physically affecting music that verges on catchy synth-pop, and on “An Intention,” that physicality manifests as a heartbeat rhythm. The song is about early stages of life, and grappling with being born into a name; her looping synths and expansive lyrics circle around as she contemplates discarding the ego and merging with the universe. That’s a lot for one four-minute song to contain, but in Smith’s hands, vast expanses get boiled down to just a few powerful words and notes. –Marc Masters",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_53,2017,Undercover,Cameron Cook,"An undeniable highlight from Kehlani’s major label debut, “Undercover” is a tropical jet stream of a track. The burgeoning 22-year-old star sings with a brash confidence, her vocals effortlessly gliding across the effervescent beat, as if Aaliyah were covering a monumental trap song from the future. But “Undercover” sets itself apart with its clever mishmash of stylistic influences; for example, when a crystal-clear guitar riff opens the song, it reads much more “No Scrubs” than “No Flex Zone.” “Undercover” is proof that a steadfast vision and stylistic precision are more than enough to create a forward-thinking hit. –Cameron Cook",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_52,2017,Incredible,Cameron Cook,"The stories around Future’s soulful rap have always been dramatic and borderline melancholy. Nuclear breakups, clinical depression, copious amounts of codeine—these are the themes that often serve as a window into his consciousness. So what makes “Incredible” so remarkable is its ecstatic happiness. On the song, Future finds himself steeped in a budding relationship so pure that his past demons drift away like purple haze. Extolling the virtues of both hot yoga and recreational Vicodin, he raps in a warbled Auto-Tune over a rubber-band bassline and a keyboard riff that is part present-day Rihanna, part Afropop-era Peter Gabriel. As he repeats the track’s title like a mantra, Future sounds like a man reborn. –Cameron Cook",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_51,2017,Hard Times,Laura Snapes,"Perky and despairing, “Hard Times” maps the chasm between a generation’s sunny online personae and the gaping existential holes within. It introduced a vibrant new sound for the former emo band, though the song is not as nuclear as it could be: Zac Farro’s percussion sounds like it’s played on old milk bottles, Taylor York’s guitar is a last nerve cajoled into funky discipline, and singer Hayley Williams exposes the effort of sustaining her rictus grin. That’s what makes “Hard Times” so satisfying—it’s not hollow empowerment pop, but a bittersweet dispatch from a year that felt like a punch line to some cosmic prank. “I still don’t know how I even survive,” Williams despairs. But this is how: Paramore always remake, remodel. –Laura Snapes",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_50,2017,Show You the Way,Evan Minsker,"Yacht-rock icon Michael McDonald has shown up on newer artists’ songshereandtherein the past few years, but he’s never met a younger foil as well-suited to his legacy as Thundercat. Over plush production here, McDonald’s monolithic baritone is the perfect counterbalance to Thundercat’s upper register—no surprise when you recall McDonald’s wealth of iconic duets alongside Kenny Loggins. And therein lies the other ingredient that makes “Show You the Way” full-on magic: Loggins shows up too, and the contrast between those two voices together still sounds fresh and vital decades later. The three behemoths of smooth invite us on a journey into the unknown, and while they warn about darkness, “Show You the Way” is inherently joyful. Thundercat affects a smarmy lounge persona to introduce his cohorts, while Loggins and McDonald slip into their soulful, familiar tones to reassure us that things are easier than they might seem. With music this effortless, it’s easy to believe them. –Evan Minsker",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_49,2017,Mythological Beauty,Ian Cohen,"On this finger-picked origin story, Big Thief frontwoman Adrianne Lenker addresses her mom—and her own nativity—in the most unromantic terms possible: “Seventeen, you took his cum/And you gave birth to your first life.” Such matter-of-factness runs throughout “Mythological Beauty,” as Lenker details the traumatic events that shaped her upbringing, including an older brother given up for adoption and a devastating head injury suffered from a railroad spike falling from her makeshift treehouse. The singer’s autobiography tempts histrionics, but Big Thief opt for mesmerizing understatement instead, allowing the nuances of her vocals to show which parts of the story are still raw. While it’s nearly impossible to relate to “Mythological Beauty” on a literal level, Lenker carries it through with a quiet determination that anyone can aspire to. –Ian Cohen",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_48,2017,Bad Liar,Katherine St. Asaph,"The Selena Gomez song that was everywhere this summer was her collaboration with Kygo, “It Ain’t Me,” yet another exercise in EDM guys reducing female vocalists to anonymities. The Selena Gomez song thatshouldhave been everywhere is “Bad Liar,” the best recreation of a hopeless crush since “Call Me Maybe.” It has songwriter Julia Michaels, who is well-experienced at turning songs into monologues. It got the OK from Talking Heads to strut to “Psycho Killer”’s bassline, the most poised sample major-label cash can buy. And as it has Selena singing syllables that trip over one another, would-be flirtations about your king-size bed turning into awkward tangents about rental amenities and the Battle of Troy that trail off, abashed, to nothing. The bridge is the last-ditch confession: an impassioned yelp, an over-earnest confession, a hasty retreat. Maybe it was never meant to be. –Katherine St. Asaph",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_47,2017,Crew,Jay Balfour,"On his debut studio album,At What Cost, GoldLink proudly held up a mirror to his hometown of Washington, D.C. So when the single “Crew” snowballed into a smash, it felt like an inclusively feel-good celebration. On the song, GoldLink manages to distill his city’s amorphous hip-hop scene into a single sound, throwing it all on the same canvas without any overspill. He tucks into the beat so fluidly that his warm, slurring mumble clutters the music by burrowing into its nooks. Fellow D.C. rapper Shy Glizzy darts around with a shouted giddiness, stealing the show with his fist-pumping momentum. Their game is bookended by Brent Faiyaz’s monotonous, elegant chorus, the type that could appear on the song two more times and not be enough. But like the best summer hits, “Crew” instead begs to be repeated in full. –Jay Balfour",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_46,2017,Star Roving,Katherine St. Asaph,"The big risk of taking 22 years to release new music in the genre you helped codify: sounding like a copy of a copy of a buzz band. The somewhat smaller, even likelier risk: getting the schtick done just good enough to have some cursory content for the inevitable reunion tour. Undoubtedly, this was on Slowdive’s mind upon their return this year, but any worries were misplaced. There are innovations in “Star Roving,” chief among them a notably beefier guitar line. But what’s here is largely what you know and missed: Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell’s vocals trailing sculpted paths like air currents, lyrics like snapshots of fleeting moments of love. It doesn’t seem implausible, given a little reshuffling of history, that 500 bands might have lived and breathed offthis. –Katherine St. Asaph",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_45,2017,Slip Away,Chris Randle,"The title promises something demure, even shy, but the music generously reneges. “Slip Away” is a rapture of excess, layering drums atop each other as if daring the tower to crumble. Mike Hadreas allows himself to get swept up in it; compression gives his singing a disembodied intimacy, his voice seeming to hover between various frequencies. The transcendence “Slip Away” describes is fleeting and overwhelming, concluding nothing, a reverie in the midst of survival: “It’s singing through your body/And I’m carried by the sound.” –Chris Randle",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_44,2017,To the Moon and Back,Jazz Monroe,"On its own, “To the Moon and Back” passes for mindless hedonism. “I want to run my fingers up your pussy,” Karin Dreijer sings, sounding merry, almost, her litany of come-ons recited in sing-songy groans over a cartoonish hook. The song trades her 2009 debut’s surrealism for something more sensual, the naked thrill of fuzzy lips and creamy kisses, and it sounds euphoric. But considered as part of her second album,Plunge, this song assumes a new, insurrectionary subtext. “This country makes it hard to fuck,” Dreijer cries on “This Country,” another of the record’s queer anthems declaring that liberation begins in the bedroom. “Every time we fuck we win.” “To the Moon and Back” is the sound of that victory. –Jazz Monroe",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_43,2017,The Bus Song,Judy Berman,"Is there anything romantic about a city bus? It’s cramped and loud and lurching and, as a companion of Jay Som’s Melina Duterte protests here, often smells. But it’s also a public place where you can be alone with your thoughts, even if you’ve got someone’s elbow in your face, as you stare out the window and slowly roll toward your destination. “The Bus Song” moves at that same unhurried pace. Its route is circuitous, meandering lazily through Duterte’s restless mind. A one-woman band in her bedroom studio, she strums and drums with a light but steady hand while unfurling her sleepy croon over plainspoken expressions of frustration. She is observant enough to know her relationship is a car about to break down, and she’s doing the mature thing—giving the other person space—even as she stews in desire and suspicion. There is nothing romantic about a city bus, which makes it the perfect vehicle for letting go of your sentimental attachments so you can keep creeping forward. –Judy Berman",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_42,2017,The Louvre,Jenn Pelly,"The emotional precision of “The Louvre” is overwhelming. It bottles the ecstasy of a beginning, when you still float with the conviction that your nascent love is, or could be, an artwork of “Mona Lisa” proportions. It’s as if Lorde devised each line of “The Louvre” so that we might have a more perfect language for this state of mind—lines to tweet and put in captions and type, all-caps, into a sacred group text (i.e., “I AM YOUR SWEETHEART PSYCHOPATHIC CRUSH”). Nothing could better capture the unruly, self-possessed feeling of chasing your heart when you know it’s wrong than “blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you.” No line more readily or immaculately transfers the anxiety of text-based infatuation, the fundamental imperfection of a DM, than “I overthink your punctuation use.” Formally, “The Louvre” contains a sly inversion: winding all of its tension and bombast into its verses and then letting them slowly unravel in the anti-chorus. “Megaphone to my chest,” it goes, “Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom/And make ’em all dance to it.” It’s an elegant description of putting your own vulnerability on blast, one that could just as easily apply to tweeting your feelings as to releasing the best breakup album of the year. –Jenn Pelly",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_41,2017,Nothing Feels Natural,Judy Berman,"Katie Alice Greer is not the kind of lyricist who hides behind abstractions. On early releases, the Priests singercalled outBarack Obama andcitedthe number of slaveholders who signed the Constitution. But the Washington, D.C. rock quartet’s first proper album,Nothing Feels Natural, is partially an object lesson in the impossibility of communicating clearly—as an artist and as a human—while you’re buried under personal and political crises, and its title track is a mess of pronouns and negatives that feels purposefully disorienting. When Greer finally makes a concise statement here, it’s one of disillusionment: “To people in sanctuaries/All I can say is/‘You will not be saved.’” The clarity comes from the texture of the music itself, like a dream that captures a feeling the conscious mind can’t articulate. Equal parts surf rock and the Cure, Taylor Mulitz’s bassline slithers through a dense forest of rumbling drums and clanging guitar. Greer’s wail sounds uncharacteristically remote, as though she’s in breathy pursuit of a melody forceful enough to tame her unruly thoughts. The words “nothing feels natural” never come up in the song, but that sense of altered perception is present in every sound. –Judy Berman",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_40,2017,911/Mr. Lonely,Nate Patrin,"In some songs, loneliness is a nagging undercurrent or the trigger for a moment of deep regret. For Tyler, the Creator, it’s an emergency. Wiping out in the supercars that he buys to fill an emotional void that’s grown massive since his early outsider skater days, the Tyler of “911/Mr. Lonely” is blunt to the point of honesty about his isolation—even when that isolation’s in front of a sold-out crowd of thousands. It all pivots on the song’s narrative shift, from sweating his thirst levels in the first half to admitting that so much of what he does is an attempt to break a feeling of detached alienation. Sure, he’s got other people to rely on—Steve Lacy from the Internet and singer Anna of the North weave in and out of Tyler’s voice on the hook, and Frank Ocean evokes early-morning and late-shift restlessness in the same short bridge. But Tyler opens up so much about his own deep ennui that the song still feels like you’re being situated between one man’s set of headphones, sinking into the meditative space. –Nate Patrin",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_39,2017,LOVE.,Ryan Dombal,"Kendrick Lamar has made his name on an intense type of endlessness. His ability to stuff so many words and meanings into a song, verse, or even a single line constantly astounds, burnishing his reputation as a genius who is mesmerizing in his density. In this light, “LOVE.”—the most straight-ahead pop song of Lamar’s career thus far—sounds utterly radical. Amid Kendrick’s furious lightning storms, this blissful rap ballad is a blue-diamond sky punctuated by the puffiest of clouds. “LOVE.” glides like an update on every great R&B slow jam of the ’90s, nodding to simpler times. In between spaced-out beats and utopian synths, Kendrick’s flow matches the simplicity of the song’s message: He’s not cracking skulls with triple entendres, but he’s not phoning in a sappy Valentine’s card, either. Currently engaged to his high school sweetheart, the 30-year-old is familiar with commitment and the ease that can come along with it. “I’d rather you trust me than to love me,” he attests on the hook, offering wisdom beyond infatuation. His word is his bond. –Ryan Dombal",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_38,2017,Deadly Valentine,Ben Cardew,"It seems fitting that this song comes from one of modern cinema’s most compelling actors. Charlotte Gainsbourg’s “Deadly Valentine” drips with dramatic tension and celluloid fantasy, wrapped up in a perfectly attuned blend of mournful melody and disco production. The latter is courtesy of producer SebastiAn, who marries the well-loved traits of French house—foot-stomping disco beats, filter sweeps, pulsating synth harmonies—to electrifying string rushes. To this, Gainsbourg adds the kind of infuriatingly simple vocal melody that destroys the heart and gets stuck in the head, her understated delivery adding mystery to the song’s dramatic sweep, like an actor subtly raising an eyebrow. Her twists, turns, and contrasts make “Deadly Valentine” both instantly satisfying and enduringly rewarding, a tour de force of musical storytelling that you can still bug out to on the dancefloor. –Ben Cardew",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_37,2017,Deathless,Olivia Horn,"French-Cuban twins Naomi and Lisa-Kaindé Díaz are no strangers to death. Their 2015 debut as Ibeyi is haunted by the ghosts of departed kin, including their father, the famed percussionist Miguel “Angá” Díaz. But “Deathless” turns their elegiac songwriting inside out, trading mourning in for triumph. Singing lead, Lisa-Kaindé recalls an incident from her teenage years when a Parisian police officer harassed her in the subway, and though her normally dulcet voice is streaked with the jagged scars left by that episode, she turns the story into a statement of solidarity with “everybody that feels that they are nothing.” The Díaz twins push back against the epidemic of police brutality via assists from Kamasi Washington, whose turbulent saxophone licks feed off the urgent tone set by Naomi’s drumming, and the raucous cries of a gospel choir. Ibeyi may not be able to fix one of the most prevalent issues facing people of color around the world, but they sure as hell won’t stay silent about it. –Olivia Horn",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_36,2017,Doomed’’,Marc Hogan,"Moses Sumney’s ghostly falsetto has the ability to raise hairs and tingle spines, and “Doomed” features one of his finest vocal performances yet. Minimally accompanied by sighing synths, his expressive flutter swoops and soars, always precisely calibrated in service of emotion, with a creaking timbre that reminds us this amazing instrument is part of an actual human body. That Sumney is using it to convey an existential void, born from lack of love, only renders the overall impact more devastating. The prospect of impending doom has rarely sounded so purely beautiful. –Marc Hogan",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_35,2017,On My Mind’’,Louis Pattison,"Jorja Smith’s feature on Drake’s More Life track “Get It Together” made her a name to watch on both sides of the Atlantic. In the past, this might have seen the 20-year-old UK artist funneled into a music industry strategy where her Englishness was watered down in the name of broad transatlantic appeal. On the contrary, though, “On My Mind” feels utterly, quintessentially British. A kiss-off to a former lover that’s done her wrong, it’s a collaboration with Preditah, whose productions trace lines between grime and its immediate predecessor, UK garage. The skippy beat is a perfect canvas for Smith, whose voice carries bruised wisdom and a budding defiance. “Nothing sweet about my misery,” she sings. But this track—a rapturous hymn to love, heartbreak, and getting over it—begs to differ. –Louis Pattison",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_34,2017,How Do You Sleep?,Ben Cardew,"As a keen student of rock music, James Murphy must be aware of John Lennon’s 1971 track “How Do You Sleep?,” a scathing attack on Paul McCartney. Murphy also likely knows “Dead Souls,” a Joy Division B-side from which LCD Soundsystem’s “How Do You Sleep?” cribs its rolling drum rhythm. But Murphy has always been adept at remodeling rock history to his own means and he proves it again on this savage character assassination. Lyrically, the song is a pin-sharp takedown of Murphy’s former DFA Records partner Tim Goldsworthy, poetic and even funny without dropping its predatory intent. Musically, it marries funereal drum patterns to a synth line so monolithic, it might crack your speakers. But what makes the track really pulsate is Murphy’s vocal, a wild howl into the void that sounds as if he’s trying to reach Goldsworthy’s UK headquarters all the way from Brooklyn without the distraction of a microphone. It’s furious, intense, and borderline unpleasant—and it opens up new emotional territory for LCD Soundsystem, right when they need it most. –Ben Cardew",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_33,2017,Biking,Matthew Strauss,"Everyone has a secret obsession. Not necessarily a passion, just a fascination that you can’t shake—the static thoughts that lull you to sleep after a long day. For Frank Ocean, this preoccupation appears to be riding his bicycle, and “Biking” is about a feeling of freedom and solitude, the moment of mindless solace between life’s challenges. JAY-Z and Tyler, the Creator frame the track, respectively playing the out-of-touch uncle who fails to relate and the gearhead who can’t grasp the substance beyond the wheels. But the key perspective comes from Frank, whose musings on the weather and heavy thoughts about love and commitment flit by with equal levity; it’s all the same when he’s on his bike. –Matthew Strauss",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_32,2017,Nyakinyua Rise,Paul A. Thompson,"At first, Indiana producer Jlin’s “Nyakinyua Rise” feels like a prelude: It sounds as if a half-dozen component parts are restlessly arranging themselves, waiting for a climax that never comes. In the meantime, they riff and fight and are enjambed on one another until a rhythm emerges. Djembe patterns are punctuated by chanted vocals, auxiliary percussion is panned frantically left and right. In the song’s latter half, the pace picks up and the sound bed grows thicker—skewing closer to traditional footwork—and those vocals, which first were allowed to breathe, start to get triggered and shortened like the sample clips they are. And then it’s over. –Paul A. Thompson",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_31,2017,Big Fish’’,Jamieson Cox,"Vince Staples likes to leave his work up for interpretation, and his refusal to dictate the meaning of his music has a marked effect on the way you receive a song like “Big Fish,” the quasi-title track on his bracing LP,Big Fish Theory. At a bare minimum it’s a club-rap slapper, one that feels like it never stops ascending thanks to its thick, tinny production. Staples slots in two economic verses, while Juicy J’s hook lets the good times roll. It’ll do wonders for you on a workout playlist. But, if you dig a little deeper, you’ll notice “Big Fish” is pockmarked with the same anxiety and guilt that colors so much of Staples’ work: The margins between cruising around town in a foreign supercar and ending up broke or dead are slim. The rapper pays his debts by working hard and keeping kids on the straight and narrow, but he can’t shake the darkness in his rearview mirror. It’s in this context that Juicy’s introductory promise—“You can get anything you want, know what I’m saying?”—starts to sound less like a celebration than the start of some devilish bargain. The world might be your oyster, but you can never really leave your past behind. –Jamieson Cox",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_30,2017,Cut to the Feeling,Jenn Pelly,"You know the feeling: sinking, stomach-twisting, life-consuming longing—the kind that seems to grow from the earth and take hold of your whole self, cell by cell. It sits at the very edges of total euphoria, and “Cut to the Feeling” is crucially about that pull toward the ecstatic. Carly Rae Jepsenwantsto cut to the feeling; she’s not there yet. How is it possible that this perfect pop song didn’t spend 2017 hovering at the top of every chart in existence? Who let her keep it offE•MO•TION? Jepsen’s best single since “Call Me Maybe” was allegedly axed from her 2015 album for being “too cinematic,” but the song will now soundtrack millions of lives that feel like movies for the rest of time. It is the dark and glittering sound of running full speed on a boardwalk at night, of sitting on a roof under the stars, these perfect places with proximity to the infinite. –Jenn Pelly",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_29,2017,Truth,Jazz Monroe,"Kamasi Washington, a composer of largely vocal-free songs, nonetheless stands among the most politically articulate artists around. On his I EP, the saxophonist uses broad titles—“Integrity,” “Knowledge”—to root his warm, communal jazz in concepts that are at once timeless and urgent. “Truth” is a nearly 14-minute suite comprising six movements, each entangled with the knotty conflicts of the last, surging toward a collective redemption. When his sax finally arrives, it sounds soft and assuring; in successive phrases, his solo grows sprawling arms and beckons the rhythm section into them. He’s soon greeted by a gospel-choral motif that sounds like a sigh contorted with hope. Like many feelings aroused by Washington’s work, the harmonic mesh has the feeling of something lost so long ago, you begin to wonder if you dreamt it. –Jazz Monroe",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_28,2017,Love,Jillian Mapes,"Lana Del Rey seemed less like an old soul when she emerged from the shadows of internet novelty six years ago. In fact, she seemed like something entirely new. But over the course of four albums, she has evolved into the poster child for all things vintage—an aesthetic evolution that’s paired nicely with her increasingly world-weary wisdom. “Love” is not simply a song about being in love; it reflects on the thrilling possibilities of the heart and asks the kids not to squander the moment. This deliberate, mid-tempo ballad is not something a 19-year-old starlet could get away with singing. The signature LDR blend of the future and the past is present, as muted gunshots and swirling sirens fly over warm mellotron, Phil Spector-style drums rendered in slo-mo, and a touch of tenderness borrowed from the Beach Boys. “Don’t worry, baby,” she deadpans, never quite promising that everything will turn out all right. –Jillian Mapes",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_27,2017,(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,Vrinda Jagota,"Sampha’s gripping debut album,Process, is a record full of anxiety and mourning around his mother’s death, and on “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” he spins that pain into a stunning piano ballad. It is ostensibly an ode to the instrument he has played since he was 3, but the detail that rings loudest is its location: in his mother’s home. The song serves as a way of addressing Sampha’s profound loss, and the resilience needed to survive it, by praising the instrument that helped him cope. The warbles of the London artist’s vibrato glide like melting butter over sparse keys as he unearths feelings that he kept close while serving as his mother’s primary caretaker. Before Sampha’s voice begins, and after he fades out, we are left with just notes and chords, a reminder that sometimes words pale in comparison to the quiet comfort of a piano. –Vrinda Jagota",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_26,2017,LMK’’,Eric Torres,"The immediate pleasure of “LMK” lies in its hook’s uncomplicated message: Just let me know how you feel already, because otherwise, what the hell are we doing here? It’s transparency delivered to a new flame in order to receive the same in return, simple and easy yet crying out. Kelela’s divine debut albumTake Me Apartexamines plenty of these kinds of back-and-forths, especially ones between strangers on dark dancefloors, but “LMK” winnows such interactions down to their essence. The singer conveys her death blow to indecision through exacting yet playful kiss-offs and an elastic mix of deep bass, booming handclaps, and low synth lines. But ultimately, it’s her uncontrived candor, no-nonsense and vulnerable at once, that makes “LMK” such an effective floor-filler. –Eric Torres",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_25,2017,The Opener’’,Quinn Moreland,"“The Opener” is a manifesto of survival. It’s built around the gendered criticism that has been leveled at Camp Cope during their years in Melbourne, Australia’s indie scene: that their success is just dumb luck and not the outcome of hard work, that women can’t sell out venues, that bookers often see them as a box to tick off. Mimicking a clueless promoter, songwriter and guitarist Georgia Maq seethes, “‘Yeah, just get a female opener/That’ll fill thequota.’” Despite her fury, “The Opener” never explodes into a chorus of rage. Instead, Camp Cope maintain a measured, hookless guitar-drum-bass chug throughout, their consistency emphasizing their formidable chops. The song’s only real dynamics come from Maq, whose jagged voice lands with force while still revealing a profound hurt. When she bellows, “Well, see how far we’ve come not listening to you” at the end of the song, it’s a triumphant reminder that their persistence has paid off. –Quinn Moreland",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_24,2017,New York’’,Jillian Mapes,"The literary genre of “Why I’m Leaving New York” essays had a moment a few years back before becoming a full-blown cliché. It remains difficult not to roll your eyes at coast-swapping writers wistfully denouncing downtown filth (and not just because they’re friends you hope don’t become Hiking People). But somehow, Annie Clark escapes our skepticism. She positions her move west around a conundrum also faced by those who’ve never stepped foot in Manhattan: What do you do when everywhere you go reminds you of the one you loved and lost, when city and significant other blur into one aching mass? The question at the heart of “New York” is more direct than those typically addressed in Clark’s songs, underscored by a pared-back but still palpable piano melody and a heart-swelling combo of strings and synths. “It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends,” Joan Didion famously began when she said goodbye to all that. But “New York” offers a counterpoint as it perfectly articulates a moment when the city suddenly seems a lot less interesting. –Jillian Mapes",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_23,2017,Drink I’m Sippin On,Jay Balfour,"Yaeji flits between genres and languages with quiet self-assurance. Throughout “Drink I’m Sippin On,” she raps and sings in both Korean and English, always sounding calmly centered over an 808-anchored trap beat with a nebulous house vibe. It’s a song of and about repetition, ostensibly a swaggy night-out anthem as outlined in the title, but actually agnostic to booze or drugs. On the chorus, she softly sings a phrase in Korean—translation: “That’s not it, no, that’s not it”—over and over, refusing to be pinned down and sounding almost spiritual in the process. It’s often tempting to describe a house singer’s voice as “soaring” because of the way the genre creates space on top of the beat instead of inside it. But on “drink i’m sippin on,” Yaeji’s actually floating in the middle of the mix, levitating on her own gorgeously meditative mantra. –Jay Balfour",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_22,2017,The Weekend,Katherine St. Asaph,"“The Weekend” details a mind-blowing, part-time affair, but it largely comes from a Sunday perspective, that feeling of leaving and lacking. SZA’s man has an arrangement that’s all business, weekday 9-to-5 stuff: one girl clocking in, one girl clocking out, dirty deeds scheduled to the exact hour and minute. She uses a sample of a Justin Timberlake track about setting the mood, transplanted into the moment when that mood’s slipped away, seen off by a wistful sigh of guitars and keys. SZA slips between the perspectives of girlfriend and girlfriend-in-waiting, neither of whom are exactly satisfied, neither of whom quite commit to bragging or complaining or wanting much more. The situation is just a rigged game, one you can only win for a couple days at a time. –Katherine St. Asaph",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_21,2017,T-Shirt,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Given their utter triumph over the mainstream this year, it’s become easy to forget that Migos have been doubted every step of the way: by traditionalists, competitors, even followers. And more than any other song on their crossover opus,Culture, “T-Shirt” feels like a riposte to those naysayers who said the trio would never make it this far. Did you write off Migos as a triplet-spitting one-trick pony? Behold as they effortlessly wield a variety of flows over a disorienting, codeine-slow beat. Thought the other members would never emerge from Quavo’s shadow? Watch Takeoff steal the show with his staccato delivery, and Offset flash a vocal range and command of melody previously unseen. Accused them of not paying due respect to their elders? Well, here’s an entire hook built around a lyric by the late Southern rap ambassador Shawty Lo, just to remind you how deeply rooted in Atlanta the group remains. But the best thing about “T-Shirt” might be the fact that you don’t need to know a single thing about Migos’ long journey to the top to enjoy it. It’s a lean rap song that places the emphasis where it belongs: on a group of certified hitmakers who are only now hitting their stride. –Mehan Jayasuriya",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_20,2017,Slide,Jillian Mapes,"There is, at once, everything and nothing calculated about the magic of “Slide.” The song is built around not just the idiosyncratic sound effects of Migos’ Offset but also Frank Ocean, a vocalist so talented and yet so seemingly bored with singing normally that his go-to aesthetic tic is now a balloon-sucking yelp. And yet, set against Calvin Harris’ graceful disco piano lines, relaxed-fit funk grooves, and soft-focus ’80s drum machines, Frank’s pitched-up nonsense rhymes give “Slide” an edge of newness. The summertime hit cements Frank’s guest spots as the main course of whatever friend’s dinner party he deigns to attend. –Jillian Mapes",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_19,2017,IDK About You,Jeremy D. Larson,"The synths Karin Dreijer uses sound like blades being sharpened. They are present on “IDK About You,” the thrilling center of her second album as Fever Ray,Plunge, and the vein-busting beat, made by the young Portuguese producer Nídia, make them seem covered in blood. Listening to Dreijer interrogate some mortal plebe over whether they are worthy of her is exhilarating—and intimidating: “Anybody’s coming with me/Gotta love my tracks/And swing an ax.” Got half of that covered; just let me check on Amazon’s ax-shipping policy. –Jeremy D.

2017_18,2017,Baby Luv,Jeremy D. Larson,"Last month, at her first American show, the London-based singer-songwriter Nilüfer Yanya closed with this song. She stood alone onstage, gently pulling chords out of her electric guitar. “Baby Luv”’s subtle dynamic shifts, little revs within the verse, tease out its wistful nature before the confrontational chorus hits: “Do you like pain?” But the real marvel is in Yanya’s indie-pop precision, her preternatural ear for something both dramatic and effortless, as if the act of kicking puddles were turned into a song. She dives and alights on her words like Young Marble Giants by way of Joni Mitchell, and her voice can light candles and snuff them out in the same breath. Surely one day there will be a band behind her, and a full album with bells and whistles, but an indelible pop song like this needs no ornaments to improve it. –Jeremy D. Larson",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_17,2017,Thinking of a Place,Jamieson Cox,"In the War on Drugs’ music, you’re never quite sure where the road leads, but you have faith it’s safe to travel. Bandleader Adam Granduciel’s romantic, mysterious vision of America is at its most expansive on the 11-minute “Thinking of a Place.” It’s a slow, loping epic that takes familiar elements from Granduciel’s discography—gauzy synths, wheedling harmonica, a guitar solo that stumbles around the beat—and stretches them into unfamiliar positions. And like much of his work, it doesn’t tell a love story in any traditional sense. Instead, it approaches the idea of transcendence from multiple angles: Love is a ghost just beyond our grasp; lovers melt into each other entirely; and thinking of a place is enough to make it real. Meanwhile, melodies blur and stack like thin clouds on the horizon, and the knockout hook lands after you’ve long since passed into a meditative state. Granduciel once titled an albumLost in the Dream, and “Thinking of a Place” feels like the culmination of that idea: You can lose yourself in this song forever, moving through a twilight that never fades. –Jamieson Cox",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_16,2017,Magnolia,Cameron Cook,"“Mumble rap” has become somewhat of a loaded term, criticized by both appreciators and detractors of the style. But when it works, it works. Twenty-one-year-old Atlanta rapper Playboi Carti’s “Magnolia” raised the standard for infectious, mainstream hip-hop this year, using a blend of perfect production and slurry rhymes. Tumbling across  the fattest, shakiest, dirtiest bass to ever be blasted from a Maserati, Carti’s droning cadence hypnotizes as he cycles through the same images: crack dealers, police altercations, careening through New York decked out in Rick Owens. It’s a lilting loop of a song, repetitive to the point of delirium. –Cameron Cook",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_15,2017,The Gate,Seth Colter Walls,"For all the playfulness she can conjure with her videos and stage shows, Björk approaches creative renewal seriously. It’s one of the traits her hardcore fans treasure, but this unpredictability can go both ways; when you want bangers, she may give you chamber-music abstractions. On “The Gate,” she splits the difference. The first minutes are devoted to whispery trails of sound, before an arpeggiated motif teases a new momentum. When the low-end eventually hits, a sense of release is tied to a pair of refrains: “care for me” and “care for you.” As she alternates between those chants, the song’s arrangement turns its most galvanizing percussive figures loose, and reciprocity becomes a reality. –Seth Colter Walls",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_14,2017,Real Death,Sam Sodomsky,"Taking place a week after the death of Phil Elverum’s wife, Geneviève, “Real Death” describes his failing, grief-stricken mind and body. It culminates in an unforgettably harrowing scene where Elverum collapses in tears on the front step of the house they once shared. The song is at once a negation—art about death that addresses the futility of making art about death—and an affirmation. Like the gift from his wife that arrives at his doorstep in that pivotal scene, “Real Death” is a sign of love, one that can bring you to your knees even if you know exactly what’s coming. –Sam Sodomsky",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_13,2017,The Story of O.J.,Marc Hogan,"On “The Story of O.J.,” JAY-Z repeats the ugliest epithet in American history with relentless purpose. The track’s sample source is Nina Simone’s haunting 1966 classic “Four Women,” which dramatized how the legacy of slavery encircled black women, and the mogul’s point here is similar: America will always see him, first and foremost, as black. With self-deprecating intimacy that’s rare for Hov—and exaggeration-prone cleverness that’s not—he argues for his empire-building as a step forward for racial progress. Provocative? Of course. But it’s also a brilliant anthem for the era of Black Lives Matter, as complex and irreducible as an individual. –Marc Hogan",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_12,2017,Passionfruit,Sheldon Pearce,"Throughout Drake’s segue from sad-boy rap architect to world music ambassador over the last few years, few songs have nailed the universal sound he’s coveted as much as this one. Throughout the track, Drake’s tone, as genteel as it is unfussy, is hypnotizing as it wafts over dancehall-lite rhythms. It’s the most assured he’s seemed in this direction since “One Dance,” playing up a struggle for control with a long-distance lover. There’s still some angst—this is a Drake song—as he sounds put off by the prospect of not being the center of someone else’s universe. But amid this song’s smoothness, such troubles feel easy to sweep aside. –Sheldon Pearce",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_11,2017,HUMBLE.,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Kendrick Lamar has long exhibited the masterful ability to dip his toes in the mainstream while keeping one foot firmly planted on the street. “HUMBLE.,” hisfirst-eversolo Billboard No. 1, cements that legacy. Mike WiLL Made-It’s production deserves equal praise; the sinister piano melody that dominates the song strikes with as much percussive force as the drum beat itself, instantly recognizable as it thundered from car windows and storefronts all summer. But Kendrick’s bars still take center stage. He remains comfortably in the pocket, right through the moment he summarily executes the ubiquitous “ayy” flow, as a bevy of lesser rappers fight overwho started it. Despite its name, “HUMBLE.” is a righteous exercise in braggadocio. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_10,2017,Boys,Sasha Geffen,"Charli XCX’s most effective bursts of bubblegum pop take place in a sphere all their own: not in the club, not in the street, not in the hotel room, but dreaming while at all three. “Boys,” her sparkling ode to male objectification, is a party song that’s about missing the party altogether: Her friends are blowing up her phone, and she’s ignoring them, lost in a daydream that doesn’t fixate on any romantic interest in particular so much as “boys” the plural noun, the natural resource, the element. The chiptune squiggle that punctuates the word in the song’s chorus makes it sound like Charli’s racking up boys like coins inSuper Mario Odyssey—a shower of boys in each city, boys raining from the heavens, boys streaming through the gutters, boys like tokens redeemable for oversized stuffed animals. Note that Charli isn’t idly contemplating her chosen currency: She’s “busythinking ’bout boys.” This is work, and she reaps the rewards every time she names her prize. –Sasha Geffen",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_9,2017,Frontline,Obbo,"Throughout her debut album,Take Me Apart, Kelela built on all the strengths of her previous mixtapes and EPs: meticulousness, emotional clarity, and those stunning, bold vocals. “Frontline” is the acme of this careful practice; as Kelela recounts her decision to leave a relationship, a sense of resolve washes over the listener in a luminous wave. The song is an invitation to view the entire R&B landscape from Kelela’s vantage point—to understand how she looks to both the past and future with limitless possibility. This isn’t easy to do. With each passing year, as R&B gets gradually subsumed by other genres, Kelela insists that the influence of the cherished artists that came before her still deserves its spotlight. “Frontline” proves that she is the right person to make sense of R&B today and lead the charge. –Vanessa Okoth-Obbo",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_8,2017,Mask Off,Jayson Greene,"When Future released two albums within a week of each other early in the year, he was banking on a song called “Draco” to push him over the top. But “Mask Off” had other ideas. The song’s buttery-soft flute lick—lifted lovingly by producer Metro Boomin fromSelma, a late-’70s musical about the life of Martin Luther King, Jr.—quickly mesmerized #FutureHive, spreading alarmingly from there. Fan tribute versions flooded the banks of social media; the loop was recreated with flutes, violins, alto saxophones, trumpets, and hilariously off-key caterwauling.Grovergot in on the action, as didSpongeBob. It spawned its own dance. It was maybe the most deathless doodled bit of music of the year, the sound of the entire internet whistling to itself. –Jayson Greene",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_7,2017,Dum Surfer,Philip Sherburne,"How ugly can you make a song without sacrificing its groove, its swagger, its sex appeal? That question lies at the heart of King Krule’s “Dum Surfer,” a track so sullen, so contorted with disgust, so miserly with its compassion, that it can’t even bother to spell its own title right. As a deeply British snapshot of a drunken night out, the song is as unsparing and brutal as photographer Dougie Wallace’sportrayalof the nation’s pub crawls and stag parties. A post-punk bassline sounds like it’s ricocheting down a back alley, and that implied distance only reinforces the sense that there’s no warmth here, no belonging—just wasted bodies dodging disaster on unforgiving streets. You can practically smell the desperation: The lyrics reek of puke and warm piss, “skunk and onion gravy,” potato mash. Musically, though, the song makes something nearly beautiful out of all that damage, as jazz guitar and baritone sax drip like red velvet curtains. Archy Marshall’s feral snarl sounds like self-laceration with a dull knife, but it’s also strangely seductive. When he warbles, “Now my brain’s diluting with blame and guilt and hash,” it’s almost enough to make you sidle up to the bar and order a shot of whatever he’s having. Almost. –Philip Sherburne",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_6,2017,Chanel,Thea Ballard,"Given the drought that precededBlonde, the handful of singles Frank Ocean released this year felt nothing short of a blessing. The first and most potent of these songs, “Chanel,” quietly reveals a new era. Though the track is built on a melancholy piano phrase, it ultimately trades the wistful air that markedBlondefor an attitude that’s present and self-possessed—speaking not as the Frank of relationships past, but as the Frank of now. Its musical flourishes—a winding flute, muted percussion, the occasional cash-register click—represent another understated step forward for Frank’s future-leaning pop, which drips with easygoing cool. His wordplay is dense, though, as it meanders through locales and references, from Tokyo to that recurring swimming pool, from provocative director Gaspar Noé to 21 Savage. These are, of course, all secondary to the French fashion house and its double-C logo: “I see on both sides,” he sings. Locating oneself on both sides of a dichotomy is, for Frank, a source of strength and even opulence: His guy is pretty like a girlandhe’s got fight stories to tell. “Chanel” flexes a muscular sense of self, redefining what it sounds like to assert power. –Thea Ballard",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_5,2017,XO TOUR Llif3,Kristin Corry,"The unlikely story of this song began when Lil Uzi Vert took a stage dive into a Geneva, Switzerland crowd in February, losing two phones filled with unreleased material amid the throng. Instead of fretting, he simply leaked everything he recorded for his debut album, including “XO TOUR Llif3.” With no marketing and no artwork, the song gained traction on SoundCloud before becoming one of the most ubiquitous hits of the year, garnering more than 1.3 billion streams worldwide. This unlikeliness extends to the song’s sound, which blends trap production with Uzi’s emo lyricism about his now-ex-girlfriend and substance abuse issues. Channeling the goth-tinged emotion of some of his favorite rockers, including Marilyn Manson, the Philadelphia rapper turns a morbid hook—“Push me to the edge/All my friends are dead”—into a delirious sing-along. –Kristin Corry",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_4,2017,Love Galore,Alex Frank,"“Love Galore” is the perfect introduction to the compelling character that SZA inhabited on her debut album,Ctrl: the petty, sexy, confused, high, confident, complicated, dismissive, cool twentysomething unafraid to air out her business (and yours). There is something cinematic about the way SZA paints her scenes in this tale of toxic romance, the way she is able to write language as it is actually spoken, the way she draws you into her world, like all of the best protagonists. By the time Travis Scott shows up for a verse that’s basically a booty call, everyone who is listening knows that she deserves better; let’s hope, by now, she does too. –Alex Frank",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_3,2017,Green Light,Quinn Moreland,"From the ashes of burnt romance rises “Green Light,” 2017’s most defiant expression of pop euphoria. Lorde hassaidthat the song channels the spirit of a drunk girl dancing herself clean, calling bullshit on her ex, and waiting for—no,demanding—a new reality. Like its spiritual and sonic predecessor, Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” “Green Light” demonstrates that emotional self-discovery does not follow a straight path but yo-yos between extremes. While opening herself up to new sounds, the New Zealand singer jumps from whispered intimacies to ecstatic, explosive choruses that encouragedenting the roof of your SUVwhile wearing a gown and Adidas Superstars. It is an anthem of fluorescent catharsis that gave a dark year some much-needed brightness. –Quinn Moreland",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_2,2017,DNA,Jayson Greene,"On “DNA.,” Kendrick Lamar dances breathlessly on the head of a pin, unwinding a single idea about origins, nature, nurture, and destiny. “I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA,"" he declares in the first verse. This animating thought—that we carry the seeds of our greatness and our undoing inside us at all times, that we are forever just one breath from our most exalted and debased behavior—runs like a vein of gold beneath Lamar’s catalog, and he’s never before drilled into it with the fierceness and precision of “DNA.” Over its escalating and spiritually replenishing three minutes, he doubles down and subdivides this notion so many times, from so many angles, that there is almost no interpretive work left for his listeners. He’s lived the life, done the work—“Born inside the beast/My expertise checked out in second grade”—and we simply receive his story. In this way, Kendrick is maybe our closest modern analog to Chuck D—like Chuck, Kendrick doesn’t beg you to see the world through his eyes, or ask that you enter into his mind. He proclaims. But where Chuck’s messages and voice were crisp and clear, Kendrick’s isn’t here to offer you slogans. He’s hoping that his all-devouring intelligence, his actorly control of inflection, and his sheer technician’s ability to dart around, inhabit, or smother the beat will help him devour the world, in all of its impossible contradictions. You can almost feel his imagination thrashing itself apart: “I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption/Scholars fathers dead with kids/And I wish I was fed forgiveness.” What is there to do with this tidal wave of information except to simply stand in front of it, letting it envelop you? –Jayson Greene",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2017_1,2017,Bodak Yellow,Briana Younger,"Cardi B is not just a rapper; she’s everything we needed, just when we needed it. And “Bodak Yellow” is not just the banger of the year; it’s an unignorable antithesis to a political landscape built around xenophobia, racism, and sexism. The first solo female rap track to hit No. 1 in nearly 20 years, it emboldened many of the people—especially women of color—who were marginalized for the very things that anchor the Afro-Latina star’s impenetrable pride. It let them lift their middle fingers a little higher and shout a little louder over the voices that wished them silent. All year long, Cardi B was a mesmerizing display of what it looks like to win without having to code-switch or shrink, and “Bodak Yellow” was her blaring anthem of purpose. By now, the story of Cardi B’s rise is legend: A fed-up grocery store cashier quits her job to become a stripper, then parlays Vine and Instagram notoriety intoreality TVstardombefore achieving ubiquitous fame with her first single for a major label. Could there be a more modern depiction of the American Dream? That “Bodak Yellow” was the flash point makes the victory even sweeter: It’s full of charismatic bravado, endless flex, and abundant joy. Cardi’s cadence, inspired by Kodak Black’s “No Flockin,” is injected with her unfuckwithable energy, as authentic as it is contagious, igniting a blend of enraptured aggression and bona fide club hysteria. Her voice is fiery and insistent, her Spanish-hued Bronx accent clipping and languishing as she offers clever wordplay about getting head and getting paid; even without knowing her hard-hustling rise, the celebration in her voice has an inclusive edge. Her braggy lines also belie a thoughtful core. Cardi may be on top, shuffling through praise, diamonds, and dudes at her whim, but in her glee she’s opening the door to her listeners, her sisters: This lifestyle, or any triumph they so choose, feels like it may just be in their reach, too. On and off wax—in a wholly demoralizing year that still became, indisputably, hers—Cardi B owned who she was. Her confidence, which disallows shame and silence, spilled into “Bodak Yellow” and created a perfect storm: a song thatfeelsgood from someone who rose to dominance at a time when women and their stories were simultaneously under attack and given more cultural space. At its heart, Cardi’s breakout demands that its listeners reclaim their power, jumping over all barriers of race, class, and gender. She did it. And while there’s still a long way to go for many like her, her existence and this song served as beacons across 2017, liberating us from our own realities, four minutes at a time. –Briana Younger",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2017,Pitchfork
2018_100,2018,Rich & Sad,Ryan Dombal,"On April 11, 1964, the burgeoning Beatles both topped theBillboardcharts with “Can’t Buy Me Love” and set a record for the most songs in the Top 20 by a single artist, with six. That record held for 54 years, until this May, when Post Malone placedninetracks in the Top 20, including “Rich & Sad” at No. 14. Some may consider this changing of the guard a pop travesty of apocalyptic proportions—or, at least, a shameless byproduct of newfangled streaming metrics—but there is actually some kismet at work here. “Rich & Sad” is buoyed by a psychedelic wheeze that recalls nothing less than “Strawberry Fields Forever,” and the song’s regretful message is a 21st-century twist on Paul McCartney’s 1964 revelation that more money does not necessarily lead to love. “I would throw it all away/I just keep on wishin’ that the money made you stay,” Post laments, sobbing into a pile of hundred dollar bills. The track brings the latent woe in the singer’s voice to the fore—how he often seems to be sinking in quicksand while yowling of the spoils of success, like a forehead-tatted canary in late capitalism’s doomed coal mine. Because as long as there are rich pop stars who need real love, there will be songs about how they can’t afford to find it.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_99,2018,Stock Image,Grayson Currin,"For Miya Folick, the traditional stress relief of a therapeutic soak isn’t working. At the start of “Stock Image,” she climbs in the warm water but only remembers to leave when it’s become so cold that she’s physically blue, too. In this vulnerable moment, she forgives herself for her faults and embraces her eccentricities: “You hide in the bones of a stock image,” she sings at the close of her chorus, her voice taking on a sudden operatic tremor. Pulsing drums and radiant synths propel and lift her, goading her into sharing intimate details—the hair swept under her bed, the long stares in her mirror, the fact that she struggles with it all. Avoiding escapism and platitudes, Folick pushes past hardship by first accepting it. “Stock Image” is a rare multivalent motivational song, as much a poke in the ribs as it is a reassuring pat on the back.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_98,2018,Self Care,Evan Rytlewski,"Mac Miller let us know he wasn’t all right. In interviews, the rapper was always open about addiction, and on his final album,Swimming, he was even more candid and unflinching. No song painted a grimmer portrait of his final months than “Self Care,” a stark account of the external and internal forces that drove him to self-medicate; the track's only relief comes in the form of a woozy coda that plays like an implicit relapse. Following his death, the song is even more difficult to listen to, especially a wishful line about having all the time in the world. Miller may have recognized that he was waging a losing battle, but there’s still something beautiful about his resolve to keep fighting.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_97,2018,In My View,Marc Masters,"There are biblical overtones to “In My View,” from Young Fathers’ third album,Cocoa Sugar. In this Scottish trio’s half-rapped, half-sung verses, references to kings, saints, sinners, and Delilah abound, and wisps of background vocals evoke a holy choir. If this is a hymn, though, it’s a harsh one, with a chorus insisting that progress comes with a price, possibly suggesting an eye-for-an-eye worldview. But nothing in “In My View” is perfectly clear, even if it is one of Young Fathers’ most accessible tracks to date. The group is still adept at crafting music and messages that don’t lend themselves to easy interpretation, no matter how clearly the words are delivered. So “In My View” becomes a sinewy soul song that swings and sways while riding an undercurrent of tension and uncertainty. Sweating out a marching band beat while simultaneously meditating on desire and betrayal, Young Fathers make anxiety sound smooth, and then the opposite, too.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_96,2018,Comeback Kid,Rebecca Bengal,"Maybe now people can stop calling Sharon Van Etten “confessional” and stop assuming her songs are purely autobiographical. In “Comeback Kid,” the first single from her forthcoming LPRemind Me Tomorrow, she comes across as something between a film noir heroine, anOutsiders-esque rebel, and an aging boxer. She’s put away the strings and pedal steels in favor of synth and organ, at times bringing to mindSiouxsie Sioux. And in the song’s video, she’s all dark-pop ’80s glam in blood red lipstick, with an unwavering stare. “I’m the runaway, I’m the stay-out-late,” she declares, tough and incandescent.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_95,2018,Moon River,Alex Frank,"Joaquin Oliver, an avowed Frank Ocean fan who lovedBlondeso much he’d dyed his own hair to match, was only 17 when he was gunned down in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting this past February. The same day, Ocean released a cover of the melancholy “Moon River,” fromBreakfast at Tiffany’s. It was a coincidence; Ocean has made a habit of dropping songs untethered to any external schedule, preserving his shrouded, shamanic presence. On its own, his version already had a haunting quality, his quivering voice splitting harmonies over plaintive keys. But accordingto reports, some friends of Oliver’s saw the confluence as “divine timing,” the lyrics about a “moon river, wider than a mile” and “crossing it in style someday” ringing like a blessed premonition of their friend peacefully floating away. There have been so many random shocks of tragedy this year that mourning can feel a daily experience. But here, in Ocean’s chance release of “Moon River,” was proof of our world’s unplanned joys, too. It was the ether providing a balm at the same time it produced tragedy: an old-fashioned song sung in 1961 by Audrey Hepburn, pitch-shifted by a modern healer into something to soothe us. Joaquin Oliver might never have gotten to hear the song, but Frank Ocean’s “Moon River” will now always be his, a tiny consolation for a tragedy too big.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_94,2018,Love Me Right,Marc Hogan,"“Love Me Right” is a wounded plea to a romantic partner who’s gone cold, a sumptuous R&B anthem that dips into house, samba, even smooth jazz. It’s also a neat snapshot of what New York singer, songwriter, and producer Amber Mark does so well. Her lyrics are conversational, relating to feelings anyone could experience, and her delivery rarely feels flashy. But her husky voice and globe-trotting sensibility bring all this to a place of understated opulence. In songs, as in relationships, intimacy sometimes means not having to spell everything out for the other person—and in the case of “Love Me Right,” the other person justdoesn’tget it, and it’s not clear if they ever will. So when Mark asks, “Why won’t you realize you gotta love me right baby?” it already sounds like she’s moving on.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_93,2018,T69 Collapse,Simon Reynolds,"It’s hard to think of another electronic artist who’s enjoyed a late-career rejuvenation like Richard D. James. Instead of glum, self-plagiarizing stagnation, his artistic middle age has been a sustained eruption of surprise and delight. Continuing his current run, theCollapseEP bursts its skin with ripening creativity: a feeling of plenitude caught in its vocal snippet that promises to lead the listener to “the land of abundance.” Opener “T69 Collapse” is an apt herald of the richness within. It starts with the whispery crispness of intricately edited beats, skidding and slipping like a tap-dancer on an oily floor: a flashback to the serene frenzy of late-’90s drill‘n’bass, when James and his IDM comrades strove to beat jungle at its own breakbeat game. But things get really interesting mid-song, when the collapse referenced in the title occurs: a juddering tumble of drums that feels like an astrophysical rupture, time itself swirling down the cosmic plughole. The tune then pulls itself together like reversed film of an explosion, gliding out with feverishly dainty beatwork offset by a typically Aphex pensive melody, daubed in milky synth so tonally smeared it feels like your ears are being pulled out of focus. Twenty-seven years into his recording career and approaching his life’s half-century mark, James exhibits a limber vitality and an evergreen joy in creation that’s as remarkable as it is enviable.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_92,2018,Track 10,Jillian Mapes,"Released at the very end of last year, Charli XCX’sPop 2mixtape saw the electro-pop star perfecting her ongoing collaboration with maximalist bubblegum collective PC Music. Closer “Track 10” serves as a fitting end to a record in which angelic, sugary electronics easily turn dark, even grotesque. An odyssey of trust issues, the song is able to achieve that rare balance between extreme artifice and total honesty: Amid an effervescent rush of beats and vocal loops, Charli XCX hits the bridge and suddenly we’re home free, fear turned to fearlessness under the force of her belt. Her voice frays through the Auto-Tune at one point, like a speck of mud flung onto something very shiny, before giving way to harps and trap. As this crumbling volcano of a song goes down, it leaves the listener with one last “It’s Charli, baby” whispered in their ear. As if it could be anyone else.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_91,2018,Ring the Alarm,Marc Masters,"Fellow Philadelphians Moor Mother and DJ Haram each make dense, noisy music on their own, butSpa 700, their debut EP under the name 700 Bliss, is as subtle as it is bracing. On the release’s sparse highlight “Ring the Alarm,” Haram constructs a rhythm that’s both insistent and halting, creating an experience that feels like listening to your own heartbeat. Into this web, Moor Mother injects blunt statements rapped with authoritative urgency, punctuating her repeated phrases with quick breaths. One of her bullet-like couplets—“You heard what I said/That anti-black’s programmed in your head”—sticks particularly hard, shot as it is through the barrel of Haram’s increasingly intense samples. The duo’s imperatives for action are certainly clear and timely, but “Ring the Alarm” shows that political music can be nuanced and brutally effective at once.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_90,2018,Hate the Real Me,Paul A. Thompson,"Future’s music traces the occasionalsoaring victoryand plenty other wins that are small, petty, spiteful. He’s interested in making you jealous of his furs and his girls; private flights to tropical villas are worth it if an ex sees them on Instagram and feels a pang of envy. But none of these things—pettiness, spite, Turks, Caicos—are the animating force behind Future’s music. That would be pain—the raw, uncut sort that lingers in the belly for years without end. “Hate the Real Me,” the last track on his and Zaytoven’sBEASTMODE 2, recognizes that pain as unresolvable. On the chorus, Future drones, “I’m tryna get high as I can”; the first verse has an extended passage about a woman describing her attempts to sleep with him, and then he lists each person who’s heard the rumor while sounding increasingly, irretrievably empty. There’s a reference to when he was shot as a teenager and a startling aside: “A sober mind wasn’t good for me.” Even his voice trembles.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_89,2018,Party for One,Katherine St. Asaph,"A lot of people still want a sequel to “Call Me Maybe,” perhaps none more than Carly Rae Jepsen herself. But even though everything she’s released since has followed a similarly winsome template, “Party for One” is Jepsen’s first explicit sequel to that hit. The intros are strikingly similar, the synths in the background play the same melody as the strings of “Call Me Maybe,” and there’s a direct lyrical callback. Again, Jepsen pairs sweeter-than-average music and blunter-than-average lyrics.For decades, it hasn’t been remarkable for a pop star to refer to masturbation—but itisremarkable to do so while setting the disarming, 1 a.m. “you don’t care about me” text to the sugariest of hooks. “Party for One” sounds like ending credits music for a teen movie that adults love too, the kind where angst is resolved and new love blooms in one glorious party of dancing and cheering and synchronized bursts of spangles. And like all good Carly Rae Jepsen songs, it makes that sound like the very first time.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_88,2018,Anna Wintour,Laura Snapes,"Maybe it’s aVogue/voguing pun, but Anna Wintour is an odd talisman for what Azealia Banks has described as a song “about finding myself.” The legendary, bobbed magazine editor is an icon of consistency. Azealia Banks is… not an icon of consistency. Mercifully, on “Anna Wintour,” the rapper’s messy public persona yields the floor to a bracing showcase of her dexterity. She pulls triple duty as house diva, raging wraith, and cold-blooded killer, nailing each part and metabolizing Junior Sanchez’s fiercely generic Ibiza track into a raw energy source. “Anna Wintour” joins “thank u, next” and “Honey” among the few songs about self-love released this year that betray greater depth than vapid Instagram inspo, and it offers a reminder of what makes the often-frustrating Banks so great: Like this song’s namesake, she knows how to keep us looking.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_87,2018,Stir Fry,Simon Reynolds,"Compared with Migos’ 2017 single, “MotorSport”—which had a wafting ethereality that pointed to a new post-trap direction—follow-up “Stir Fry” has the trio playing by old-school rules, and winning. Originally made for T.I. but never used, Pharrell’s beat is from 2008 and harks back even further still, recalling the raw funk of Neptunes productions like Mystikal’s “Shake Ya Ass.” Running through the whole of “Stir Fry” is a nagging ear-worm that’s positively primordial: a whistling motif based on an organ lick from Mohawks’ 1968 R&B tune “The Champ,” already sampled hundreds of times in hip-hop. Takeoff, Offset, and Quavo ride the loping, breakbeat-like groove, reeling off references to cheap fast-food chains that contrast with their more standard name-checks of expensive foreign watches and cars. It fits the contradictory aspiration expressed in Quavo’s Auto-crooned hook: the wish and the vow to “still be real and famous.” This was the year Migos became a meme: parodied in a “SNL” sketch, piling into James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke.” They now exist somewhere between street and simulacrum, turning snapshots of vice and viciousness into blithe and buoyant entertainment. The tongue-twisting, lip-smacking assonance of this irresistible single’s chorus—“In the kitchen, wrist-twistin’ like it’s stir fry”—makes crack preparation seem as harmless and wholesome as a cooking show.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_86,2018,Distortion,Mark Richardson,"Over 11 riveting minutes, “Distortion” finds Mount Eerie’s Phil Elverum taking a series of plainspoken vignettes from his life and fastening them into a winding meditation on birth, life, death, responsibility, and resilience. We hear about the first two times Elverum saw a dead body—his great-grandfather, as a kid, and then his wife and the mother of his young child—and two portraits of wild young men who stare down the prospect of becoming fathers before they are ready. One of these is Elverum himself, who at age 23 hears that he may have impregnated someone with whom he’d had a random sexual encounter. And the other is the writer Jack Kerouac, the subject of a documentary Elverum watches during a long flight. There’s a lot to take in, and these stories at first seem arbitrary and unconnected. But as the song builds, they fold in on each other, collapsing the lines between past and the present, between reality and imagination, between what we can’t quite remember and what we will never forget.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_85,2018,APESHIT,Eric Torres,"No one was prepared for “Apeshit.” The lead single from Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s surprise joint album brims with cocky gratitude for the high life, flaunting Bey’s head-spinning flow and Jay’s louche, laid-back delivery over an expensive, pop-trap background courtesy of Pharrell. While clearly indebted to Migos, whose demo of the song leaked just a few days after the Carters’ came out, “Apeshit” is further proof that the zeitgeist belongs to this power couple, who can claim a cultural moment whenever they please. Bey lists off fashion houses and sports cars like they’re items on her grocery list, but it’s her sneering “Get off my dick” that really sets the tone. Of course, the song is only half the story—the lavish video for “Apeshit,”one of the year’s best, finds the Carters lounging and dancing around an empty Louvre in designer fineries, a seamless mashup of icons old and new.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_84,2018,Vlone,Evan Minsker,"Valee is a serene individual. He keeps an indoor koi pond. And when an ABC sitcom hired him tomake a cameoas himself, he was asked to portray a thoughtful, patient listener. As usual, the rapper is a calm presence on “Vlone.” He only has a handful of lines in the song, and none of them bestow any real wisdom—he just talks about the clothes he’s wearing. “These are vintage jeans,” he half-mumbles before offering a clipped affirmative: “Mhm.” The song is a subdued flex coupled with a borderline sleepy delivery. He’s got nice things, but he’s not going on and on about it. Over minimal instrumentation, he’s literally telling you to leave him alone. Especially if you’re broke.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_83,2018,Believe,Madison Bloom,"Freedom, Damon McMahon’s fifth record as Amen Dunes, is sprawling and shimmering, lingering somewhere between a memory and a daydream. Nowhere is this more true than on “Believe,” which examines the false promise of nostalgia while fully enveloped in its rosy glow. The song is built upon a series of impressions: snatches of spiritual imagery, glimpses into a childhood scored by the radio, brief pronouncements of devotion rounding out otherwise unintelligible verses. These details simmer over insistent plucks of guitar and swells of harmonica, building to a cathartic climax as McMahon gives thanks for his past and confronts his future head-on.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_82,2018,Macaulay Culkin,Marcus J. Moore,"In what’s been a breakout year for Baltimore rapper JPEGMAFIA, “Macaulay Culkin” offered a brief glimpse into the man behind the music, sans all the piss and vinegar that made up his excellentVeteranLP. On this rare moment of reflection, he name-checks a few recognizable figures to assess how he truly feels behind the scenes. “I got my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin,” he spits at the top of the two-minute track. “Black man, white fam, I feel like Jason Jordan,” he claims, referencing the WWE star. He’s Rick and Morty in the science lab, Mulder and Scully solving mysteries. All of which is to say: There’s no telling who you’ll get from one JPEGMAFIA track to the next.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_81,2018,Life Is Beautiful,Michelle Kim,"It hurts to hear Lil Peep acknowledge that life can be worthwhile. He does it a lot, perhaps with some irony, in “Life Is Beautiful,” a song originally written and released in 2015 and then gorgeously reworked for the emo rap star’s posthumous album,Come Over When You’re Sober Pt. 2. On the track, Peep presents myriad of examples of how devastation is part of everyday life, whether it takes the form of a soul-crushing office job, being targeted by the police, or pining for the approval of your crush. But after each one, he seemingly shakes his head while asking the question: “Isn’t life beautiful?” The track’s producers, Smokeasac and IIVI, envelope his melancholy vocals with pooling synths and creaking cello lines, giving it a pulsating, breathing quality. In all its wounded grace, the song gets a chance at new life.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_80,2018,Thanks 4 Nothing,Philip Sherburne,"Nilüfer Yanyais noAriana Grande. Where the megastar won platitudes for her magnanimity in “thank u, next,” the young London singer’s “Thanks 4 Nothing” is the bitterest sort of kiss-off. Yanya’s protagonist doesn’t just see the world through a glass-half-empty lens; she takes a sip and smashes her tumbler on the ground. “Will you and I waste this?/I won’t even try in case it don’t work/I hate you and I hate this,” she sings, her voice as unsteady as a small, wounded bird. Romantic fatalism has rarely been so straight-up nihilistic. Fortunately, Yanya knows how to make the most bilious heartbreak not just palatable, but even refreshing. Her pitter-pat drum machine and clean-toned guitar evoke the most wistful strains of vintage UK soul and indie, likeSadeandEverything But the Girl, and her voice is nothing short of revelatory, capable of drawing a one-syllable word into a four-note melisma in the least showy way possible. And the vulnerability of her tone, octaves jumping like a catch in the throat, is the balm to counterbalance all that scorched-earth attitude, injecting every breath with a potent mixture of defiance and regret.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_79,2018,Sticky,Jason King,"Nineteen-year-old R&B singer Ravyn Lenae may have been classically trained at the Chicago High School for the Arts, but she’s got a jones for experimental, jagged, synthy beats and left-of-center soul. Taken from her third EP,Crush, which was produced by the Internet’s Steve Lacy, “Sticky” is a full-tilt, psychedelic slow burn. By turns freaky and hypnotic, the song is like Lenae’s version ofPrince’sSign o' the Timesdeep cut “Strange Relationship”—the lyrics find her flummoxed in love, under the spell of topsy-turvy emotions. The intro, a flood of standalone organ chord changes, already sounds legendary; by the time the blunted groove drops and the hiccup melodies in the verses follow, you’ll be hooked. But it’s Lenae herself that makes “Sticky” glisten: Her gossamer mezzo sounds like a wicked mix ofKate Bush,Minnie Riperton, andAaliyah.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_78,2018,The River,Philip Sherburne,"Lolina,the experimentalist formerly known asInga Copeland,has always played her cards close to her chest. InHype Williams, herduowithDean Blunt, she toyed with further aliases, offered only the most cryptic interview responses and performed masked or from deep inside a dry-ice fog. Her 2018 albumThe Smoke, which switchbacks through dissonant piano counterpoints and spindly Casiotone fugues, is not much more forthcoming. “The River” is the album’s most immediate track—it could almost be a vintage Tricky outtake, but trip-hop is rarely as unsettling as this. Synths chatter like roosting birds and beats drop out when you least expect, throwing her words into relief against sudden silence. Lolina switches between singing and speaking modes like someone who can’t decide whether to jog or to walk, sounding sullen and playful all at once. The conflict at the center of the song—“You tell me, ‘Open your eyes’/That means I won’t”—sounds like as true a thing as she’s ever sung. Wherever this river may lead, both its origin and its destination are known only to her.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_77,2018,OKRA,Matthew Strauss,"Tylerhasn’t talked his shit like this in years. Maybe he’s been too busy—launching a successful fashion line and music festival, making TV shows, and taking on the role of rap’s easy-listening radical with 2017’sFlower Boy. His deliberate empire-building across this decade almost makes you forget that he established his brand on total chaos, that he crunched down on a cockroach and staged his own hanging in the “Yonkers”videoalmost eight years ago. A spiritual successor to that breakout hit, “OKRA” is an unapologetically hard banger celebrating Tyler’s many wins. A blown-out bass ushers in Tyler’s crooked, Valee-nodding flow, as he rolls through an abundance of imperial lines including, “Tell Tim Chalamet to come get at me.” Consider this song a sneering reminder that the goblin is still somewhere inside him.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_76,2018,Devotion,Alphonse Pierre,"Tirzah sings “I just want your attention,” and time stops. When the British artist allows a line to leave her mouth, it lingers, intimate and close. On “Devotion,” desperation is felt in producer Mica Levi’s looped instrumental, elevating Tirzah’s quiet urgency with every slow-moving piano key and woozy beat of the drums. She wants it all, without exception: all the comfort, all the understanding, all the love. This is her plea, vulnerable to the point of transcendence—her aching desire to be with one other person only.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_75,2018,Hyper-Intelligent Genetically Enriched Cyborg,Daphne Carr,"In its dark, hypnotic call-and-response of acid squibs and synths jumping over distorted snares, “Hyper-Intelligent Genetically Enriched Cyborg” feels like a peek into the best rooms of techno’s past: the clubs of 1994 Berlin, or the industrial spaces of Cleveland in 1988. But this standout track from Helena Hauff’s excellent second album, Qualm, is rooted firmly in the present, too, down to its title subject matter: This year, pop culture has percolated with paranoia about technology, and, quietly, we’ve already seen futurism realized in gene-modified births. The techno future is here, and if we haven’t spent a lot of time questioning its fancy new tools—who has them, how they should be used—then we ought to. Hauff’s radical politics make it easy to hear this track as a sonification of the mind of such a gene-“cleansed” genius cyborg, as unmoored from humanitarian ethics as the corporations who built it. So listen warily to this siren’s warning.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_74,2018,Noid,Jazz Monroe,"“Noid” seems to present an artist reborn: an antic experimentalist pivoting to pop in riotous fashion. But close inspection reveals Yves Tumor to be as intense as ever, with the song lurching into urgent extremes. It’s perhaps the year’s most visceral response to brutality against black bodies, refocusing the singer and producer’s dissident energy into music that involves, enraptures, and implicates. As Tumor repeats a few biting phrases (“9-1-1, can’t trust ’em...”), time seems to stall in a heightened moment, as if violence might be imminent. The beat propelling the cinematic strings, so harried and urgent, would sooner flee than fight, and indeed seems already on its way. From there, “Noid” presents a spectacular balancing act in which paranoia threatens to snap into terror. Rarely is radical art so neatly set at the precipice of delirium.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_73,2018,Sold Out Dates,Paul A. Thompson,"Both Gunna and Lil Baby grew from Young Thug’s rib, but the pair’s breakout collaboration, “Sold Out Dates,” owes just as much to Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3.” It’s a mission statement for overmedicated troubadours with chemical dependencies, low-level paranoia, and $20,000 in one-dollar bills. “Dates” is produced by Turbo and Ghetto Guitar and sounds like the kind of thing a grizzled country star might pull out at an after-hours club, much to the dismay of his three publicists. Gunna and Lil Baby are likely destined for different kinds of stardom—slow-and-steady and stratospheric, respectively—but “Sold Out Dates” finds them perfectly in concert.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_72,2018,Ladies,Eric Torres,"Slowthai raps like every song is his last gasp. “Ladies,” a paean to the women who shaped the UK grime MC, is no less fevered, but it’s also his most open and wholehearted song yet. Delivered over a stuttering, 8-bit beat, Slowthai’s lyrics jump from the gaps in his teeth to the promise of a yellow brick road, rattled off with a characteristically impish grin. But there’s newfound tenderness and an unexpected kind of feminism here as he raps, “I appreciate queens ’cause they made us.” It’s a quality made even more evident in the accompanying music video, where he lays naked and prostrate next to a clothed woman and later faces the camera wrapped in her arms. He’s searching for redemption and, whether he finds it or not, the excursion is exhilarating.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_71,2018,Best Years of My Life,Alison Fensterstock,"Heartbreak, of course, is country music’s meat and potatoes—and Pistol Annies’ Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, and Angaleena Presley candoheartbreak. “Best Years of My Life” is a deceptively simple, devastatingly intimate domestic drama about love that left with a whimper, not a bang, and the mundane narcotics (prescription opioids and brainless TV) that help numb the ache. It’s a song that feels like listening to someone’s heart slowly snuff out from lack of emotional oxygen, with a sweet, sad, spare guitar line that slowly grows louder and fuzzier. The lyrics detail a compounded sadness; we mourn for the dead relationship, yes, but more so for all the possibilities its lingering dead weight is taking the place of. There are interior epics hidden and thrumming underneath the most ordinary events in human lives, and Pistol Annies excel at revealing them.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_70,2018,Fists of Fury,Louis Pattison,"Los Angeles saxophonist and composer Kamasi Washington’s second album commences with a rallying cry. “Fists of Fury” is a cover version of sorts, a bold refresh of Joseph Koo & Ku Chia Hui’sblaring theme tunefor the 1972 Bruce Lee filmFist of Fury. In the hands of Washington and his band, though, it becomes explicitly political: a noble call for justice and retribution that feels like a call-to-arms for the Black Lives Matter era. There is a righteous anger here, but the track itself is utterly beguiling. The arrangements invoke the rhythmic motifs of Blaxploitation funk and Latin music, massed strings adopt a honeyed swoon, and Washington and pianist Cameron Graves turn out magnificent solos that give the song’s 10 minutes a sense of perpetual lift. A feat of graceful pugilism, “Fists of Fury” floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_69,2018,Work It,Louis Pattison,"On the surface, “Work It” is a walloping dancefloor motivational for the secure-the-bag generation. Quebecoise singer and producer Marie Davidson weaves an elegant lattice of analog percussion—thudding kicks, dotty drums, clanging digital cowbell—before swooping in with a stern, business-bitch monologue listing the virtues of hard toil. “I don’t wanna see any fake-ass workers,” she demands. “I needreal builders.” Job done? Not quite. Considered in the context of its parent album,Working Class Woman, “Work It” emerges as part of a nuanced reflection on the psychological cost of being a touring musician—the physical and mental toll of hedonism, the stress of being your own boss. With this in mind, the song’s spoken text emerges as something more precarious: an admission of workaholism set to a runaway pulse that just can’t—or won’t—stop. It’s an important reminder of a truth that’s seldom spoken: You can still work yourself to death doing something you love.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_68,2018,When I’m With Him,Vrinda Jagota,"“When I’m With Him” is a Trojan horse of a song, an exuberant dance-pop banger that conceals the internal loneliness of secretly falling out of love. Like Robyn, Empress Of’s Lorely Rodriguez refracts her sorrow through assertive drums and blossoming, golden synthesizers. The track’s skipping beat and sunny production transform heartache into tantalizing melodrama. Rodriguez does this with remarkable self-awareness, acknowledging that she is repressing emotions while still attempting to articulate those tangled feelings. She sings in both Spanish and English here, and each language provides a unique cadence; the Spanish phrases in the pre-chorus tend to be more staccato, while the following English phrases flow like cursive. Like sugar added to a savory stew, the contrast enhances both sensations.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_67,2018,Boys,Jason King,"In a year buoyed by auspicious hip-hop women, fromCardi Bto Tierra Whack, Lizzo continues to brand herself as the no-fucks poster girl for the utopian promise of letting your freak flag fly. The classically trained Minneapolis musician’s single “Boys” is an infectious dance tribute to all things XY chromosome, topped by a saucy black-and-whitevideofilmed in front of urinals. The song is freewheeling retro fun: The exuberant rhythm track recalls Timberlake and Timbaland’s “SexyBack,” and when was the last time you heard an old-school electric guitar solo during the bridge? Sassy to the hilt, Lizzo laundry-lists the boys who quench her thirst (“itty bitty boys, Mississippi boys”), and her declaration “Baby I don’t need you/I just want to freak you” pays homage toMissy Elliott’s combination of raunchy good-humor and sexual autonomy. Lizzo also racks up points for her inclusive approach to man crushes when she confesses: “I don’t discriminate, come and get a taste/From the playboys to the gay boys.” “Boys” ain’t rocket science, but it’s downright subversive to hear a plus-size black woman owning her sexual lust and essentially grabbing her own pussy in the face of persistent toxic masculinity.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_66,2018,bless ur heart,Ruth Saxelby,"On the chorus of “bless ur heart,” the word “heart” swells to fill a whole line. It grows eight extra syllables and as many sonic embellishments; a wall of sound that sensually mirrors the way love buoys every molecule in one’s body. The lead single from serpentwithfeet’s debut albumsoil, “bless ur heart” is a perfect introduction to his fantastical and fleshy style of songwriting. Vocally, there are nods to his church choir background and to his Brandy fandom—the two singers utilize a tremble to texturally convey tenderness—but it’s lyrically that serpentwithfeet really flies. In a song about a lover who taught him gentleness and inspired his writing, he imagines creatures to carry his notes deep underground, stories that grow feet, and bodies that rid themselves of rivers. That love and language can both be transformative is not a new tale, but it takes a gifted storyteller to show how snugly they dovetail.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_65,2018,Sweetener,Larry Fitzmaurice,"“Sweetener” is not subtle. “Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it/Flip it, flip it, flip it,” Ariana Grande instructs on the chorus to her fourth album’s title track, resembling an X-rated game of Bop It. Amid the track’s svelte production—trickling percussion, cushy bass hits, a lusty and cascading synth line—Pharrell punctuates Grande’s commands with a high-pitched “sheesh!” like a steam whistle cutting through the air. It all adds up to a gleeful evocation of sensuality on an album consumed with the heady pleasures of new love. “Sweetener” carries a tender streak, too, embracing the notion of finding the good in so much bad, and toasting to the people in one’s life who encourage such perseverance. At a Manchester tribute concert following the deadly bombing at her show there last year, Grande said, “The fact that all of those people were able to turn something that represented the most heinous of humanity into something beautiful and unifying and loving is just wild.” And “Sweetener” embodies that same look-on-the-bright-side universality—a reminder that even the worst feelings can be turned into something radiant and nourishing.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_64,2018,Loading Zones,Seth Colter Walls,"In the space of a few seconds, Kurt Vile blends several feel-good guitar textures on “Loading Zones.” When the opening wah-wah flourish gives way to more intricate acoustic fingerpicking, the singer-songwriter shows an ability to channel artists as different as Peter Frampton and Fleet Foxes. In the first verse, his droll voice unspools in lines of uneven length—telling a fractured, dreamlike story about an improbable small-town power broker—suggesting a sincere love for vintage talking blues. Happily, none of this weaving of popular traditions sounds forced; the song’s distractible journey is the work of a mellow, lightly perplexed narrator. By now, though, Vile’s more committed listeners likely understand the narrative haze as the work of a deceptively purposeful songwriter, one who knows exactly where he wants to lead them.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_63,2018,Heat Wave,Noah Yoo,"Snail Mail’s “Heat Wave” is built atop contradictions. The song begins as a delicate ballad before unleashing triumphant, devil-may-care bursts of fuzzy indie rock. All the while, Lindsey Jordan displays both a tonal brattiness appropriate of her 19 years and a worldly wisdom, as she addresses a green-eyed ex who’s decided to move on: “I hope whoever it is holds their breath around you, ’cause I know I did.” Toward the end of the song, the rhythm section quiets and Jordan introduces a bold refrain—“I’m not intosometimes”—that turns into an anthemic distillation of unrequited young love. “Heat Wave” is neither acerbic farewell nor mopey retrospective, but a clear admission of the pain of rejection, and the hope that we’ll all eventually find whatever it is we’re searching for.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_62,2018,Hands,Will Pritchard,"How do you follow up a sleeper rap hit? That was the question faced by London MC Octavian after “Party Here” catapulted him into the mainstream (thanks to one Aubrey Drake Graham). The answer: An idiosyncratic slice of dreamy electro-R&B. “Hands” does away with anything resembling traditional song structure. Instead, twinkling synths, pitch-shifted lyric snippets, and a driving bassline are brought together in experimental, James Blake-esque interplay. In all its genre-bending oddity, “Hands” serves as a clear sign that this young artist has ambitions that go way beyond a Drake co-sign.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_61,2018,Having Been Is No Way to Be,Stephen Deusner,"Jeff Tweedy has been around long enough to know that any song he releases is a song that he'll have to live with for the rest of his life. So “Having Been Is No Way to Be,” off his memoiristic solo albumWARM, sounds like he’s keeping his future self in check, crafting a surefire live staple that will force him to confront his urges and addictions night after night. The music is low-key, humble even: a loping acoustic strum; a low and sympathetic bass, like a steadying hand on his shoulder; a room-spinning guitar solo. But the lyrics are some of the most probing he’s ever written—in particular when he’s confronting the fact that some fans prefer the music he made while addicted to painkillers to the songs he wrote after he got clean: “But they’re not my friends/And if I was dead/What difference would it ever make to them?” With startling honesty, “Having Been Is No Way to Be” celebrates the fact that Tweedy gets to keep on living.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_60,2018,It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You),Ian Cohen,"Of the many, many insults Matty Healy served himself on the 1975’s last LP, none dug deeper than “I’ve been romanticizing heroin.” Whatever countercultural cachet opioids once held has been negated by the undignified deaths of Tom Petty and Prince, along with the suffering of guys like Danny, the physically broken gas station employee that Healy uses as a stand-in for himself on “It’s Not Living (If It’s Not With You).” Though it’s a dark meditation on drug use, the song could anchor a crushed-out mix if you ignore its lyrics—a decent likelihood, since it’s one of those ruthlessly efficient pop machines that merges hair metal and ’80s stadium synth-pop. But “It’s Not Living” devastates because it presents Healy—a guy who’s scrutinized every aspect of our modern existence—as someone who knows he can never satisfactorily answer the one question that tortures anyone close to an addict:Why?",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_59,2018,Four Out of Five,Jillian Mapes,"After a dozen years, six albums, and more success than anyone expected, Alex Turner is bragging about Yelp reviews on the damn moon. WithTranquility Base Hotel & Casino—and this track, its centerpiece, in particular—Arctic Monkeys present a ’70s rock lounge-lizard homage to future problems: What happens when we also ruin outer space with aggressive capitalism, gentrification, and information overload? It’s a scary, funny thought, and Turner, ever the deft vocalist, plays up both qualities in equal measure. His pitch-blackBowiecroon shows a flash of conviction when he boasts of a four-star user review for his lunar taqueria—“And that’s unheard of!” At first, the song starts and stops in fits, like a latter-dayJack Whitetrack that can’t quite figure out if it has a rock rhythm or a rap one, before taking on a dreamy psychedelic quality. Maybe the moon’s marketing creeps are lulling listeners into a fake sense of security, which makes you wonder: Who’s vetting all these glowing reviews, anyway?",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_58,2018,Heaven’s Only Wishful,Stuart Berman,"The debut single from Toronto’s Seth Nyquist bears all the hallmarks of a homespun indie-pop project: the sullen jangly guitars, the vacuum-sealed production, the skeletal “Billie Jean” beat that sounds like an outline for some pro drummer to embellish later on. And this is to say nothing of the open-ended yet intensely introspective lyrical confessions of a “poor boy” who’s “waiting for answers” and “hoping to find meaning” so that he can “break this feeling.” But despite its greyscale mood, “Heaven’s Only Wishful” nonetheless bottles up the thrill of a DIY producer realizing his potential in real time. While the song’s tempo never changes, the temperature certainly does: As Nyquist piles on Morse code squeals and grinding guitar solos, his understated cool gives way to unrestrained anger. “Some say/You’re the reason I feel this way,” he screams at an unspecified target in the song’s dying moments—an emotional breakthrough as dramatic and revelatory as his musical one.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_57,2018,Look Alive,Trey Alston,"There’s a running joke that getting a feature from Drake is like handing him the keys to a vehicle that won’t be returned: When he hops on a young artist’s track, he can’t help but steal their shine. But BlocBoy JB’s breakout single “Look Alive” bucks this trend—not only does JB manage to hold his own throughout the song, he actually draws attention away from Drizzy. Over ominous production that mixes the lowest of piano notes with bulky bass, JB breathlessly jumps in as Drake’s verse ends, radiating confidence with rapid rushes of goofy punchlines that are as witty as they are amusing (“I’ma spray ’em, just like Febreze”). After this track, JB’s career is on a fast climb, and it’s not hard to see why.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_56,2018,Miki Dora,Jesse Jarnow,"Amen Dunes’ “Miki Dora” is a wave that never breaks, a cosmic surf beat that pulses for five minutes as singer-songwriter Damon McMahon’s reassuring voice and oceanic lyrics hover above the swell. All of the song’s basic information—melody, groove, texture—arrives in the first 30 seconds, a compact and transcendental good feeling. Then the small shifts keep coming: ever-widening guitar parts around the central thump, miniature drama with a vocal modulation about halfway through, a pile of stacked self-harmonies near the end alongside guitar lines that sound like they’ve been run through a warbling cassette tape. It’s a long way from the discombobulated constructions of McMahon’s earliest work nearly 10 years ago, with the haze now transmuted into a gentle glow, the sun sinking into the digital surf.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_55,2018,One More,Jesse Dorris,"Polyglot club phenom Yaeji spent 2017 offering up track after track of deep house filtered through the minimalist insouciance of modern R&B. She was strong enough to blow through electronic music’s biases and remix nightlife in her own image, all the while launching lyrical doozies like “I don’t fuck with family planning.” But the rolling bullshit of this year left her personally betrayed, frustrated with the industry, and rationally furious. So Yaeji returned this fall with “One More,” a self-made and self-released middle finger to men who expect women to do all the work. It is amood, tossing and turning from gauzy quiet storm to Björk-y drum breaks and heartbreak, where even a quick turn towards euphoria ends up twitchy. It not only moves the body, it surely moveson.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_54,2018,I Do,Madison Bloom,"Flipping a phrase commonly associated with matrimony, “I Do” drastically shifts the narrative with just three little words: “I dowhat I like.” The closing track from Cardi B’sInvasion of Privacy, it finds the rapper taking back power in the face of hearsay—all while reaping the benefits of her self-made empire. With nods to Gucci and YSL, “I Do” can seem at times like a shopping list for Barneys, but it endures above all as a celebration of financial autonomy and sexual empowerment. Cardi and SZA stalk the foreboding beat, flexing atop skittering hi-hats and something like detuned church bells. They count out their cash and accomplishments without a scrap of shame; Cardi feels so sexually superior, she claims to shout her own name in the sack. They don’t shy away from naming their desires, but as usual, they’re not asking others to provide for them—they’ve got that part handled.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_53,2018,Wanted,Alphonse Pierre,"For many teenagers in New York—whose days are spent wandering through the city being ignored by adults and stalked by cops—nowhere ever really feels like home. On “Wanted,” Harlem’s Sheck Wes embodies that nomadic lifestyle as he tries to maneuver through a place where everyone just wishes he would go away, convinced he’s only up to no good. Realizing that he won’t be accepted no matter what, he opts to wreak havoc: boosting items from downtown to sell uptown and wilding on the subway, carving out some control wherever he can. It’s why Sheck Wes has become the voice of the unheard youth in NYC, and beyond.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_52,2018,My Queen Is Harriet Tubman,Will Pritchard,"Sons of Kemet’s “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman” is a standout from a strong year for London’s burgeoning jazz scene. The song was written as an interpretation of the famed abolitionist’s initial escape from slavery via the Underground Railroad. Tubman’s bid for freedom is brought to life in an urgent, relentless, and tightly wound melee of sax, drums, and tuba; players weave in and out like those moving along a loosely defined network of routes. The song is reflective of more contemporary times as well. Over five-and-a-half minutes, the track plumbs the UK capital’s rich, diasporic mesh of cultures: Afrobeat rhythms and freeform sax playing with an energy that resembles the golden era of pirate radio grime sets, typified by huddles of MCs passing a microphone around. Exclamatory stabs from the sax sound like reactive ad libs, and there’s a sense of unbridled joy running throughout. “My Queen Is Harriet Tubman” ends as abruptly as it began, leaving pure adrenaline coursing from ear to aorta.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_51,2018,In Another Life,Mark Richardson,"Over a bubbling synth beat and lyrical guitar fills, Canadian singer-songwriter Sandro Perri vividly imagines a better place, one where “the seed of greed dissolved in thirst.” But by walking us step-by-step through his impossible dream, steadily unfolding one verse after another for 24 patient minutes, Perri offers an additional experience that enlivens his description of this weary utopia. This parallel existence isn’t just in our imaginations: By taking the song in and following its gentle curves, we start to become one with its rhythms, syncing with its gurgling, ceaseless flow. “In Another Life” isn’t a perfect prescription—many lines don’t make sense—but rather a space to inhabit, one that can be transformational in the right headspace. As we so often find ourselves struggling to cram in every last piece of crucial data, here is a song that has all the time in the world.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_50,2018,Night Shift,Owen Myers,"It’s called the graveyard shift for a reason. Night can bring terrors, but moments of lucidity can also lurk within its quiet shadows. Lucy Dacus knows this duality all too well in “Night Shift,” a strung-out swamp of feelings about a breakup and the ensuing attempts to trying to hack away at the emotional cartilage that binds you to an ex-lover. The nearly-seven-minute track portrays a person flung off her axis and haunted by specters. Its racked, exquisite agony—and teeth-gritting determination to face the future without that loser ex—marks it as one of Dacus’ greatest songs to date. After a hushed opening, the song ignites as a chugging guitar riff cedes to Dacus screaming, in a bludgeoning wail, that she’s settled for second-rate treatment for the last time. They say that you learn something, good or bad, from every relationship. Dacus’ emotional purging feels like a much-needed vomit after a night of excess. The taste lingers, but wipe your mouth and keep on walking.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_49,2018,Always Trying to Work It Out,Sasha Geffen,"As the two vocalists of Low, the experimental rock project they’ve helmed since the early 1990s, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker play to their differences. Sparhawk’s voice has a rough, earthy grain that makes him the perfect foil to Parker’s crystal vibrato; the contrast in texture between the two lends depth to their slow, simple arrangements. On “Always Trying to Work It Out,” from the desolate landscape ofDouble Negative, Parker and Sparhawk add a new element to their vocal dynamics, texturing their voices with prismatic studio effects. Each singer’s voice fractures into pitch-shifted strands; they’re harmonizing with each other, as they usually do, but they’re also singing against alternate visions of themselves over the steady chug of a bass drum. Their voices fray and unravel, sounding as if they’re just missing each other. “Always Trying to Work It Out” stands as one of the loneliest and most poignant cuts off an album consumed with the feeling of isolation. Singing to someone and not knowing if they’ll hear you can be harder than singing to no one at all.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_48,2018,Your Dog,Billie,"Soccer Mommy’s Sophie Allison wastes no time stating her thesis here: “I don’t wanna be your fucking dog.” The ultimate kiss-off to unhealthy power dynamics, “Your Dog” seethes with resentment, as Allison recounts a partner’s offenses: emotional neglect, using her like a “prop,” choking her with a metaphorical collar and leash. Though her voice falters into tender, multi-tracked murmurs when she describes the forehead kisses that keep her coming back for more—mimicking the confusing cycle of forgiveness in a toxic relationship—Allison’s delivery throughout the song is determined and self-possessed. “I want a love that lets me breathe,” she exclaims as the track deteriorates into a squall of noisy guitar feedback. This isn’t a bruised confession about an emotionally manipulative ex: It’s a declaration of sovereignty. –Braudie Blais",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_47,2018,The Eye,Olivia Horn,"West Philly noise-pop quartet Empath’s best song yet is named for a phrase plucked from feminist poet Adrienne Rich: “the tear that washes out the eye.” Despite its literary origins, the reference is far from overwrought—Catherine Elicson, who sings, plays guitar, and writes for the group, tends to let intuition guide her lyrics, deciphering their meaning after the fact. Instead of overthinking things, Elicson doubles down on the pop form here, concocting an infectious hook while throwing in a few “baby”s for sexy punctuation and treating the poet’s words like decorative wallpaper. This subversion—de-escalating high art and lifting up the low—is a delicious twist that tops off the anarchic fun of “The Eye,” a hurtling three-minute endeavor in which drones collide with wind chimes and birdsong and indecipherable crew vocals tease juicy secrets.",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_46,2018,High Horse,Marc Hogan,"Of all the stinging one-liners on “High Horse,” the most revealing is when Kacey Musgraves declares, “You’re classic in the wrong way.” Musgraves, by contrast, has built a career out of being classic in therightway. The singer made her name on vintage, pedal-steel country with a fiercely contemporary perspective, and this song turns toward the dancefloor by reaching back for a sultry Bee Gees strut. And yet, “High Horse” is no nostalgia play. The sleek production sounds every bit as timely as the 2018 indie disco-pop of Mitski’s “Nobody” or U.S. Girls’ “Rosebud,” while the lyrical horseplay—this self-impressed loudmouth clearly won’t come off it, so he better just “giddy-up, giddy-up”—is a perfect chef’s kiss of a kiss-off.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_45,2018,Hungry Hippo,Maggie Lange,"“Hungry Hippo” is a manifesto from a hip-hop chameleon. Tierra Whack tells us we’ll never get a long look at her, someone whose interior life moves so fast, we’re lucky just to hear a flash of it. The song begins with a plinking melody, like a sophisticated ice cream truck coming down the block, before Whack’s voice arrives, dripping with glamour. “He likes my diamonds and my pearls,” she sings, preening, “I said,Thank you, I designed it.” In this way, “Hungry Hippo” gets closest to Whack showing herself as the artist behind her concealing designs. It’s one of the most flirtatious reveals onWhack World, an album of one-minute songs that Whack rolls out to us like gems before quickly snatching them back.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_44,2018,This Time Around,Sam Sodomsky,"Like all of Jessica Pratt’s best songs, “This Time Around” puts equal emphasis on the familiar and the fadeout. It’s like a gorgeous, muffled refrain from the radio of a passing car, just brief enough to get stuck in your head but too fleeting to make out the words. Pratt’s psychedelic folk music is strikingly solitary, with little more than her vocals and guitar; it doesn’t suck the listener in so much as wave them forward, to be immersed at their own pace. It’s easy to take for granted when an artist is able to conjure such strange atmospheres with such simple sounds. While the world has gotten much louder in the three years since her last album, “This Time Around” promises her sanctuary of song remains intact—as cozy and addictively alien as ever.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_43,2018,Rage,Stephen Kearse,"“Rage” evokes an immersive world in which women’s anger is as thrilling as it is cathartic. Channeling her inner berserker, Rico Nasty’s prickly rasp does wonders here, puncturing producer Kenny Beats’ thick walls of crunch and bass. Like a chain mace, Rico’s flow can be nimble or dense, swinging with the beat or smashing against it. On “Rage,” every punch lands; every shriek pierces. Rico’s rage here is deft but not directionless. As she mows down biters, doubters, challengers—basically anyone in her way—she raps with cutting precision. And as Rico channels her own fury, she also shouts out the bad bitches who rage just as hard. Any schmuck can get upset; rage, Rico shows, is a commitment.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_42,2018,Geyser,Vrinda Jagota,"“Geyser” may depict intense, undeniable devotion, but it rejects the elation typical of love songs. On the track, Mitski doesn’t recount the specific joys of being with another person. Rather, she turns inward, singing about her desire more broadly, as a force that brews like a geyser about to erupt. Mitski has explained that “Geyser” is about her relationship to music rather than romance, about how there is a certain desperation in the music made by people who know they couldn’t possibly do anything else. This sense of passion, swirling with the gravitational pull of a whirlpool, is bigger than any one person or situation.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_41,2018,Shallow,Matthew Schnipper,"InA Star Is Born, Lady Gaga’s character Ally sits in a grocery store parking lot with Bradley Cooper’s Jackson Maine, who inspires her to spontaneously write and sing a verse from what would become “Shallow.” Within a week, the pair are singing a full-band version of the song to a crazed live crowd (apparently, Maine telepathically learned the rest of it). The film proselytizes that kind of organic, meant-to-be songwriting over processed pop, though in real life, composing “Shallow” involved four different writers, including Mark Ronson and the guy from Miike Snow. If it takes that much work to make something sound so natural, it’s worth it: When Gaga hits her deep-throated yelp in the song’s back third, it’s a true punch-the-air moment of triumph. It sounds like something out of the movies. And then you realize it is.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_40,2018,Powerglide,Noah Yoo,"On “Powerglide,” Rae Sremmurd and Juicy J assert their status as some of the most successful stars in rap by invoking all the familiar tropes: fast cars, fine jewelry, fashionable women. But while Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi are bigger than ever, some things in the Rae Sremmurd universe remain unchanged, going all the way back to their “No Flex Zone” days: Mike-WiLL made it (again), and the Mississippi duo still couldn’t care less about any of their various luxuries, warbling about the byproducts of their prosperity with blithe indifference. “I don’t care if she take all of mine, like it ain’t shit but a dollar sign,” Swae Lee proclaims at the end of the chorus. Weird flex, but OK.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_39,2018,December 24,Jayson Greene,"The beat of “December 24” is woozy and warm. It has no edges. It sounds like what would happen if you tickled a Mobb Deep instrumental until it broke out giggling. It never comes into focus, no matter how you squint—if it were an eye test, you would fail it. Earl Sweatshirt keeps things blurry on purpose throughout his albumSome Rap Songs, and the decision suggests a lot of things about his worldview: False clarity is inimical to truth; metrical perfection crowds out life. He doesn’t worry about his voice syncing perfectly with the beat on this song—he just dances above it. Muffled explosions detonate in his lyrics, which reverberate with death, sickness, grief. His grandmother, eulogized on his previous albums, appears as a memory here, “on a drip drink” of morphine at the hospital. Hearts and limbs break, and Earl wonders who will help him when his own bones turn brittle. He’s 24. At that age, your bones are young, springy, quick to heal. But he sounds deeply unconvinced, as if he has intuited somewhere just how little it takes to shatter.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_38,2018,FUN!,Hanif Abdurraqib,"What stands out on “FUN!” is Vince Staples’ deliberate patience as an MC as he searches for a connective rhyme with each syllable. Even when it doesn’t work out, the attempt creates sonic pleasure. Vince is one of the best reporters working today, which is why his songs often feel like spectacular, inviting world-building. This song, which lifts its sound from the Bay Area’s hyphy scene and features E-40, is like the night after the last day of school, with nothing but warmth and endless possibilities ahead. Amid spacey and bounceable production, Vince charts the geography of a neighborhood, both at ease in it and not. There’s something special about the way he is able to unfold these spaces in a song that runs under three minutes. Nothing is wasted; everything flourishes.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_37,2018,Venice Bitch,Marc Hogan,"Over the course of the last seven years, Lana Del Rey has transformed herself from a viral phenomenon to the center of her own sad-girl artistic universe. She’s not above mainstream friendly moves, but she’s also long shown a willingness to follow her Americana muse wherever it might lead. On “Venice Bitch,” she head-fakes toward the middle of the road but ends up someplace gloriously bonkers. Lana worked on the song with Jack Antonoff, whose hits with Taylor Swift and Lorde could’ve forecast it to be streamlined Top 40 fare. Instead, “Venice Bitch” is almost 10 minutes of folk-rock introspection, as Lana mashes up decades of cultural signposts—Hallmark, a Father John Misty album name, a favorite Robert Frost line—into her own nü-Laurel Canyon epic. This is Lana doubling down on her Lana-ness: Lana squared, Lana rebootingBeing John Malkovich. Perhaps she’s commenting on the supposed stability of small-town, pre-rock’n’roll living—the album “Venice Bitch” precedes is titledNorman Fucking Rockwell—amid the gentle plucks and bleary solos of rock’s post-hippie comedown. Or maybe she’s just cracking herself up.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_36,2018,Lifetime,Jayson Greene,"The drums on “Lifetime” feel like being pulled under the ocean. Recalling the explosive fills of the Smashing Pumpkins’ Jimmy Chamberlin or the fluid, ecstatic musicality of Liturgy’s Greg Fox, they seem to be battering you from every angle, possibly moving in several directions at once. The little hi-hats feel like sharp gasps for air. Above and around this clattering mass of sound, Yves Tumor demonstrates how unusual a rock anthem can be. The song’s chorus soars upward with all the chest-beating angst of Bono circa “New Year’s Day,” but the words make no sense, or they make such a hyper-specific kind of sense that we are left entirely out of the equation. The only thing that is clear is we are being given a startling keyhole into a howling emotional storm.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_35,2018,Rosebud,Eric Torres,"Whether calling out Obama for drone killings over punchy brass or depicting the reaches of the patriarchy all the way to heaven over hiccuping record scratches, U.S. Girls’In a Poem Unlimitedis an examination of the personal, political, and purely unconventional. “Rosebud” is the album’s gorgeous centerpiece, a catchy, disco-infused jaunt cut with Meg Remy’s piercing vocals. Yet the song’s shimmering background—anchored by a smooth bassline, programmed drums, and strings—is something of a ruse. Here, Remy’s lyrics are imploring and complex, making a reference to themystery at the heart ofCitizen Kaneand flipping it to ask a meditative question:Who holds the key to who you are?Remy doesn’t offer up any simple answers, but she makes it clear that we sometimes need to dig deep to identify which factors—our upbringing, our partners, our friends—have molded us into who we are today.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_34,2018,Charcoal Baby,Sheldon Pearce,"The word “charcoal” conjures images of residue, used both as an exfoliate in beauty masks and as makeup for blackface. But “Charcoal Baby,” the highlight ofBlood Orange’sNegro Swan, is a celebration of black skin amid its many negative connotations. The song finds both beauty and exclusion in having to permanently wear blackness, in all its otherness. “No one wants to be the odd one out at times/No one wants to be the negro swan,” Dev Hynes sighs. “Can you break sometimes?” There is no freedom from the ugliness of the world, but Hynes suggests there is some deliverance in the embrace of the unchanging. His feathery tone, met at various points by a talented and barely noticeable supporting cast, wisps between an unfastening guitar riff, washed-out synths, and shimmering keys. His delicate touch brings warmth to a place of near isolation; his cooing falsetto communicates comfort. The song—in its gorgeous, understated display of beauty—is an embrace.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_33,2018,I Shall Love 2,Grayson Haver Currin,"At the start of “I Shall Love 2,”Julia Holteris suspended in a permanent daze. “I am in love/What can I do?” she asks over rudimentary keyboards and drum machines, so distracted by this odd feeling that all she seeminglycando is sit beside a window and stare at the world outside. But suddenly, strings, horns, bass, and drums cozy up to her. “I shall love,” sings a choir, emerging from the ether. She takes up their credo, singing it without interruption or hesitation for the next two minutes, as the band morphs into a symphony. The mantra becomes her flashlight through an unknown dark, a way of navigating the unseen terror of the future. Holter doesn’t try to simplify love or the complexity it entails; she embraces its significance, letting the power lift her to a new plane of strength and clarity. It’s a hard lesson to remember on our best days—and a far more necessary one during our worst.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_32,2018,Confirmation,Owen Myers,"In “Confirmation,” a balmy and left-field pop gem, Westerman puts his overactive mind on pause. With reverb-shrouded vocals that drift by like puffs of cumulus, the London songwriter radiates a near-spiritual faith in the power of art, offering mindful encouragement to move forward even when it feels impossible. That pathway is mirrored by sirens symbolizing inner tumult, which fade to make way for a bright patina of ’80s synths. Westerman’s optimistic vision is far from naïve, though. He clocks that life in a noisy world can lead to creative impasse but refuses to make that a scapegoat for inaction. (“Blame it on the establishment,” he offers as an option, before reconsidering that excuse as “so boring.”) Tethering grounded awareness with a welcome sense of escape, “Confirmation” marks the arrival of a songwriter who soothes.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_31,2018,The Story of Adidon,Stephen Kearse,"“You are hiding a child.” The line is so deflating, so uncouth, so petty that it’s beautiful. Pusha-T’s feud with Drake began as an outgrowth of his long-running tiffs with Lil Wayne and Baby, and there was no need for it to ever evolve further. But on “The Story of Adidon,” Pusha doesn’t just diss Drake; he diagnoses him, reading his charts slowly and sinisterly. The Drake he conjures is not just a lesser MC: he’s a sad, deadbeat hypocrite embroiled in generational dysfunction that plays out in his music, in his relationships, and on his scalp. Though Pusha’s rapping is more rushed than usual, his writing less artful, it’s clear his energy was concentrated on staging. The song’s artwork, an image of Drake in blackface, is unforgettable. No I.D.’s beautiful production, hijacked from JAY-Z’s “The Story of O.J.,” is made caustic. Each time Nina Simone coos “My skin is black,” there’s a readymade image of Drake missing the power of that statement by a mile. Whereas JAY-Z used O.J. Simpson as a foil, Pusha holds Drake at a comic distance, turning his foe’s story into a slapstick riot that’s as cruel as it is insulting. This dissonance is the brutal brilliance of “The Story of Adidon,” and perhaps all rap beef. As Pusha chuckles in the outro—his satisfaction unabashed, the surgery complete—it’s hard not to notice all the blood on the operation table.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_30,2018,Make Me Feel,Katherine St. Asaph,"As ever, Janelle Monáe’s image and creative vision are meticulously controlled on “Make Me Feel,” but the single ditches restraint in favor of one of the greatest subjects in music: uncontainable feelings that become uncontained over the course of a song. The crisp minimalist backdrop—which may or may not directly involve a synth by Prince—gives way to vocal and guitar outbursts, as Monáe teases “don’t make me spell it out for you” before doing exactly that withNational Spelling Bee shouts. By the end, she’s ripping holes in the song, belting “I can’t help it!” and sounding utterly free. “Make Me Feel” was co-written by prolific pop hitmakers Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, who have been making this same sort of zipped-up funk song for about two years now (think Selena Gomez’s “Hands to Myself”). But Monáe is self-possessed enough of a performer to elevate it from its workaday beginnings to someplace joyous and potentially boundless. And in thisglum, gray year for pop, it’s a relief to hear love sound so good, so fuckingreal.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_29,2018,Falling Into Me,Michelle Kim,"On paper, Let’s Eat Grandma’s “Falling Into Me” shouldn’t work. But the duo of Jenny Hollingworth and Rosa Walton are masters of streamlining a host of strange elements to create immersive universes for their glossy pop songs. For this nearly six-minute track, they manage to blend together pounding ’80s drum fills, fingerpicked classical guitar, a sea of sawtooth synths, syncopated cowbell, and an epic saxophone solo… and somehow make it not sound like the corniest thing in the world. Instead, it emerges as a sleek track with the danceability of a Lorde song. The lyrics here describe the thrilling uncertainty of getting to know a new lover, coded in cryptic imagery, from misted backstreets and night-blooming violets to dented phone screens and handprints against windows. But in the chorus, they cast off any obliqueness and distill the feeling in just three words: “You/Me/This.”",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_28,2018,It Makes You Forget (Itgehane),Andy Beta,"Just two years ago, Peggy Gou dropped out of fashion school to focus full-time on music production. The Berlin-based producer’s early singles flashed a gift for balancing house, techno, and electro, and she soon became the first female Korean DJ to make a BBC Essential Mix. But with “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane),” Gou makes a quantum leap. Daydreaming about the chaotic state of the world in her native Korean, she taps into dance music’s underlying emotions. Amid acid squelches and a spot-on ’90s house beat, topped off with a dulcet vibraphone line and Gou’s own murmurs, “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)” channels those feelings of wistfulness, of finding comfort among strangers. She captures that singular dancefloor sensation of shaking off the world’s troubles and giving in to the total euphoria of the moment.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_27,2018,In My Feelings,Alphonse Pierre,"In May, it looked like Drake hadlostthe most important rap beef since Nas vs. Jay-Z. But soon after, he quieted all that noise with one of the catchiest tracks of his career. “In My Feelings” is a New Orleans bounce-indebted No. 1 hit with production from that scene’s legendary producer, BlaqNmilD, sliced-up vocals courtesy of the city’s own Lil Wayne, and a hook so effective that it scarred every person named Kiki worldwide. The contagious track also inspired the most genuinely spontaneous viral dance challenge the music industry has ever seen—one that saw grandmasmaking heart handsalongside moving cars. Drake went from roadkill under Pusha-T’s tire to making a song that was so good, it made people risk becoming roadkill themselves. That’s power.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_26,2018,Lemon Glow,Andrew Gaerig,"Somehow, Beach House were not one of the bands invited to play the Roadhouse in last year’s “Twin Peaks: The Return.” But “Lemon Glow,” with its menacing sexiness and the accompanyingvideo’sBlack Lodgewiggle, shows that the duo remains a force when it comes to building surreal mystery. The song’s coiling riff and tittering hi-hats make it sound as if Beach House have learned something from the hip-hop producers who keepsamplingthem. And when singer Victoria Legrand lays into the chorus—“When you turn the lights down low/Lemon-color honey glow”—it feels as if she’s goading us into deeper levels of innuendo and bemusement. “I come alive/You stay all night,” she sings, confirming what we suspected all along: “Lemon Glow” is a sex jam, albeit one more concerned with the shadows than the bodies casting them.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_25,2018,The Opener,Quinn Moreland,"“The Opener” is a manifesto of survival. It’s built around the gendered criticism that has been leveled at Camp Cope during their years in Melbourne, Australia’s indie scene: that their success is just dumb luck and not the outcome of hard work, that women can’t sell out venues, that bookers often see them as a box to tick off. Mimicking a clueless promoter, songwriter and guitarist Georgia Maq seethes, “‘Yeah, just get a female opener/That’ll fill thequota.’” Despite her fury, “The Opener” never explodes into a chorus of rage. Instead, Camp Cope maintain a measured, hookless guitar-drum-bass chug throughout, their consistency emphasizing their formidable chops. The song’s only real dynamics come from Maq, whose jagged voice lands with force while still revealing a profound hurt. When she bellows, “Well, see how far we’ve come not listening to you” at the end of the song, it’s a triumphant reminder that their persistence has paid off.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_24,2018,Middle America,Stephen Deusner,"One of the most flat-out beautiful songs of Stephen Malkmus’ long career, “Middle America” derives its power from a low-key simplicity: the lovely country-rock arrangement, the pendulum rhythm of Joanna Bolme’s bassline, Malkmus’ disarmingly tender falsetto, that perfect rhyme of “You know you should be blushin’” with “to a hue of Robitussin.” For a guy who’s too often held up as the aging avatar of ’90s indie-rock irony, Malkmus doesn’t sound detached or desperate, but rather warm and wise on this wistful meditation about responsibility.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_23,2018,I Like It,Trey Alston,"Cardi B’s debut album,Invasion of Privacy, would not have been complete without a nod to her Latin roots. At the urging of her label head, Atlantic’s Craig Kallman, she began what would become a seven-month writing process for “I Like It” last fall. They started with two samples from Kallman’s vinyl collection—Latin boogaloo bandleader Pete Rodriguez’s “I Like It Like That” and “Oh That’s Nice”—and created the rapper’s second No. 1 single. It’s pretty hard to hate a song this animated, but the appeal of “I Like It” goes beyond the power of positivity. From the opening drift of horns to the bodying waves of bass, this Latin trap cut is a carefully calibrated burst of energy. Its charismatic MCs—Cardi alongside the reggaeton stars Bad Bunny and J Balvin—achieve the perfect balance: She flows and flexes effortlessly, Bunny goes hard, and Balvin exudes suaveness. Of the singles released fromInvasion of Privacy, “I Like It” is the most expansive in sound and color—no small feat from one of hip-hop’s boldest talents this year.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_22,2018,Is It Cold in the Water?,Ben Cardew,"“Is It Cold in the Water?” is appropriately titled: There’s an aqueous chill in the song’s shifting electronic undertows. As the grandiose centerpiece of SOPHIE’s debut albumOIL OF EVERY PEARL’s UN-INSIDES, the song vacillates between rave-gnarled electronics and shimmering pop emotion. The devastating impact of this combination is magnified by the track’s sense of mystery: The lyrics paint an impressionistic picture of anguished resistance, while guest vocalist Cecile Believe’s articulated strength absorbs the listener’s own fears. In a year of blowhard and bluster, “Is It Cold in the Water?” showed strength in ambiguity, its glacial charm an icy dagger to the heart of pop music.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_21,2018,5 dollars,Laura Snapes,"The handful of great singles about sex work have made their characters sound pitiful. “5 dollars” does something different. Through transactional physicality, the solicitor and solicited in Héloïse Letissier’s story get to revel in their instincts, freed from harsh gazes and self-loathing—to steal a line from Lou Reed, they experience how it would feelto be James Dean for a day. Letissier galvanizes such heroic outcasts in an air-punching chorus that makes these archetypes gleam anew: She isSpringsteenon the sidelines cheering on her cracked antiheroes, the all-American imagery of five-dollar spoils and implied blue collars lending a classic pop-art touch. How long her characters’ sense of transcendence lasts is uncertain: You won’t get far on five dollars. But that small sum contains infinite potential.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_20,2018,Rank & File,Stacey Anderson,"Moses Sumney’s falsetto is so otherworldly, it usually lends him an air of repose—like a narrator working from a sky-high vantage point. But on “Rank & File,” he burrows himself in the mud and despair of our moment, brooding in a deeper register that only exacerbates his dripping venom. The closing track from hisBlack in Deep Red, 2014EP, “Rank & File” inverts a ubiquitous chant of the armed forces—“I don’t know but I’ve been told”—into an excoriation of police brutality. A finger-snapped, martial beat mimics the implacable passage of time, while listless, numerical chanting adds to an overwhelming aura of surveillance and groupthink. Sumney pushes back against the complacency, hissing at the bloody forces threatening the black community. When he finally unsheathes his angelic upper register, it’s in wails of anguish, and it cuts to the marrow.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_19,2018,Sicko Mode,Larry Fitzmaurice,"In a year spent getting mad online, it was nice to see people experience some joy, too.“Let’s fucking focus!”bellowed hip-hop podcaster DJ Akademiks on alivestreamupon first hearing Drake on “Sicko Mode,” literally jumping out of his chair for a guest appearance from the most ubiquitous artist in popular music right now. His drunken overreaction was beautiful in its pure outlandishness—characteristics that can be applied to Travis Scott and to “Sicko Mode” as a whole. Scott’s music has always possessed a Frankenstein-like, stitched-together build, but the multi-part “Sicko Mode” goes to hilariously operatic new heights. The proggiest hip-hop song to hit No. 1 on theBillboardcharts this year, it’s essentially Rush’s “Tom Sawyer” for future ComplexCon attendees, lurching through rubbery bass lines and haunted-house organs courtesy of a small army of trending rap producers. Scott namechecks Bonnaroo and Uncle Luke in the same breath, Drake delivers his best verse of the year while talking about sleeping on a plane, and both join forces to repeat the phrase “like a light” enough times to potentially short-circuit a metropolitan power grid. “Sicko Mode” is a sonic embarrassment of riches that’s well worth embarrassing yourself online for.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_18,2018,Boo’d Up,Brad Nelson,"Originally released in the winter of 2017, Ella Mai’s “Boo’d Up” finally graduated to radio hit status in the summer of 2018, as if it needed a heat index that matched its own weather to truly unfurl. The song is a long shimmer of R&B, its synths woven into a cloud of moisture trembling in the air. DJ Mustard’s production, transmitted from somewhere far beyond the aerobic snap of his previous hits, is so relaxed it sounds gradually exhaled. Mai’s voice is remarkably steady and focused, but the words she sings constantly sink into vulnerability. It is this vision of desire as a truly bottomless feeling that makes “Boo’d Up” feel special, like a modern day version of Anita Baker’s “Caught Up in the Rapture.” The song’s chorus—“Ba-dum, boo’d up”—simulates the quickened thrum of Mai’s heartbeat, as if it were trying to speak to her, echoing distantly from the depth to which she’s fallen in love.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_17,2018,My My My!,Alex Frank,"“My My My!” possesses no more and no less than what all great pop moments need: push-and-pull lyrics about love and sex, the rush of a massive chorus that feels instantly familiar, and, most of all, the aura of a performer with undeniable charm. The fact that Troye Sivan is gay—a frustrating novelty in a genre that relies on gay dollars but does not always reward gay talent—both matters and doesn’t. Yes, it is refreshing to imagine the song as a story of infatuation between two men. But the entire point of “My My My!” seems to be about pop’s thrilling, almost old-fashioned power to appeal to anyone and everyone.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_16,2018,I Woke Up in a Fucked-Up America,Amanda Petrusich,"Every era has its prophets, and Lonnie Holley—a 68-year-old sculptor from Birmingham, Alabama, who began releasing experimental music in 2012—speaks to the anguish and tumult of modern life with extraordinary fury and perception. A version of “I Woke Up in a Fucked-Up America” has been a part of Holley’s mind-bending live set for awhile; when he performs it, the song expands and contracts in mesmerizing ways. Is it noise? Is it pop? All that’s ever truly clear is that the song is a dissonant, wounded lament for a nation under duress. It ends with an imploration: “Please, please, please/Go/Let me out of this dream.” Holley’s throaty vocals—evoking Louis Armstrong, Stevie Wonder, and Tom Waits—and his bandmates’ spaced-out clanking combine to make a gorgeous racket, while the song’s lyrics address feelings of confusion and deep disappointment. This is what it sounds like when you know the ground below your feet has been compromised.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_15,2018,Missing U,Amy Phillips,"Missing someone is a universal human experience. Everyone from newborns to centenarians knows what it feels like to stare into the abyss of “this empty space you left behind,” as Robyn sings here. But only Robyn could take that abyss and make it this kind of dance party. Arpeggiated notes glisten like sunlight on teardrops, while the pulsing undercurrent propels forward motion, out of grief and into healing. As in the most classic of pop songs, the “you” she’s addressing is whoever you want it to be; this is a song that could be played at a wake, a high school graduation party, or on a boombox outside of a lost love’s window.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_14,2018,Womp Womp,Sheldon Pearce,"Valee raps like nothing is at stake. The world is his oyster, and if there’s no pearl inside, he’d probably like it served to him Rockefeller. He’s leisure-obsessive, a connoisseur of the finer things and the pleasures they bring him. His raps are about how he already has everything, and he puts that same premium on the freedoms afforded to those with nothing but downtime. “Womp Womp,” his off-kilter collaboration with Jeremih, embodies this attitude—so much so that Valee freestyled his verse. The song, which turns along-running Peanuts jokeinto flex fodder, communicates supreme comfort without resplendence. It suggests that this pair is so used to people telling them what they want to hear that they aren’t even listening anymore—and they’ve faced no consequences for it. It’s rap showboating that’s masterful in its subtlety. This isn’t recreation; it’s lazing.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_13,2018,Self,Maggie Lange,"As the introduction toNoname’s magnificent second album,Room 25, “Self” establishes the lyrical sophistication and vocal flexibility the rapper practiced in Chicago’s spoken word community. She sets her smooth flow over a soulful bed of humming vocals, letting her inflections sting with light, tangy acidity. She unfurls stylish social critique that carries a smacking aftertaste between some perfect lines (the most perfect: “My pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism”). She is a tough judge, both of herself and the people who underestimate her. But there’s nothing knee-jerk in these critiques, and “Self” is awash with a pastel glow and beaming confidence. It’s the fantasy fulfillment of going back in time and flawlessly responding to someone who brushed you off. And sometimes that just means telling them what your pussy wrote.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_12,2018,Me & My Dog,Quinn Moreland,"“Me & My Dog” presents the complete arc of a doomed romance: dreamy beginnings, hazy disintegration, urgent end. The song begins withPhoebe Bridgersrecalling a wonderfully imperfect date over a gently crescendoing guitar. But as the strumming grows louder, her blithe infatuation begins to cool, and insecurities arise. In a crushing moment of self-doubt, Bridgers is bolstered by the voices of her bandmatesJulien BakerandLucy Dacus, and “Me & My Dog” suddenly transforms into a massive affirmation of autonomy. By the final refrain, Bridgers’ agitation reaches a breaking point and she unleashes a desire to “be emaciated”—a violent declaration that is less about becoming smaller than it is a desperate need to sever a toxic tie. She immediately counters it with a comforting fantasy: “I wish I was on a spaceship/Just me and my dog and an impossible view.” As boygenius harmonize around this escapist dream, they cling to the notion that, together, they can conquer all.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_11,2018,Slow Burn,Alison Fensterstock,"The sonic departures on country star Kacey Musgraves’Golden Hourare the gentle sort: playful explorations of disco and sunny, string-spangled pop, a fresh and guileless intimacy twining her words together. An acid trip served as the album’s conceptual genesis, and “Slow Burn,” its opening track, unfurls appropriately, with the eye-widening feeling of something new coming on. A plain, solo strummed guitar is joined by sparkly banjo notes low in the mix; effects slowly layer, with more instruments joining in. Atop this, Musgraves’ lyrics grow more expansive, turning from inward rumination to mind-expanded macro-philosophy about how to move through the world. “Whatever feels good,” she sings, and suddenly there are violins and reverb. It sounds like she’s tuned into a psychedelic zen frequency, a blissful calm.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_10,2018,Duck Duck Goose,Sam Sodomsky,"Chicago rapper CupcakKe does not hold back. At all. “I thought I came but I peed on the dick,” goes the opening line of “Duck Duck Goose,” setting the sexed-up, spit-take tone. But as producer Def Starz’s horny, neon beat throbs forward, something magical happens: The language turns surreal and downright violent—clothing is torn, members are severed—and, abruptly, CupcakKe’s energy becomes less stand-up comic and more triathlon winner. As she raps faster and with more musicality, the song turns into a virtuosic display of momentum, focus, and precision. In the final seconds, just for kicks, she drops an entirely new hook: “Vending machine/Vending machine/Can’t eat it till there’s money between.” It’s the type of mantra a lesser writer might center an entire song on. For CupcakKe, though, it’s just one brush stroke in her masterpiece of Pornhub pointillism.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_9,2018,Nobody,Jayson Greene,"Mitski is a connoisseur of surfaces. She knows exactly how to polish them until they are bright, placing the fine bone china on the side tables, making sure all the dinner forks are in order. She also knows how perfectly smooth surfaces betray us, how we can summon an earthquake of emotion to send all the pieces crashing to the floor. This clash—preternatural composure shattered by elemental feeling—is at the heart of her astonishing albumBe the Cowboy, and “Nobody” is its jagged peak, a convulsion of despair executed with the neatness of a triple axel. The song comes out sashaying, with genteel piano voicings and bachelor-pad disco flourishes. But once the words resolve into the foreground, “Nobody” becomes a gasp of loneliness so pure it hurts your lungs to breathe it in; no song broke through the year with the immediacy and desperation of “I’ve been big and small and big and small and big and small again/And still nobody wants me.” It is the sort of bald confession that clears a room, that makes people fear your misfortune to be some kind of contagion. But “Nobody” offers it with jazz hands, and in one final flourish, signs off with the two most dazzling musical modulations of the year. Coming across the song this year was like chancing upon someone’s emotional meltdown on Facebook, marked off by posts about dogs and ads for backpacks—it felt like all the worst and most exhilarating parts of 2018 compressed into a diamond.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_8,2018,"thank u, next",Jamieson Cox,"It’s been an up-and-down year for Ariana Grande, to put it mildly. She cemented her status as a member of pop’s elite with the release ofSweetener, an album that bucked prevailing pop trends and addressed anxiety and trauma with transparency and grace; within two months, she’dlose an ex-boyfriend to a tragic overdoseandcall off a whirlwind engagement, all in the harsh light of the public eye. No one would have blamed her for weathering the storm in solitude or decamping to the nearest private island. Instead, she channeled her life’s spectacle into “thank u, next,” a radical display of empathy that has become her biggest hit to date. With its soft, dreamy keys and buttery vocals, the song further refines Grande’s brand of ’90s-leaning pop-R&B. It’s a surprisingly comforting smash, one that lands in your system like a melatonin tablet and a mug of tea. And yet the song’s cultural omnipresence has more to do with the woman at its center than any particular sound. Instead of blaming the men in her life for the pain she’s endured, she thanks them for helping her become the woman she is today. In doing so, she takes the self-love that madeSweetenerso special and extends it beyond herself, demonstrating optimism and compassion on the largest possible stage.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_7,2018,New Patek,Timmhotep Aku,"On June 16, Lil Uzi Vert posted abrief videoof himself shimmying, gyrating, posing, and pantomiming to a new song on Instagram—whetting fans’ appetite for a track that would not drop for another three months. When it did, “New Patek” immediately shot to the top of streaming charts. Never have we witnessed a snippet be so effective. Uzi, noted for his stylistic innovation as an emo and pop punk-inflected rapper, had now innovated in the realm of music marketing, too. Though the teaser was bite-size, the song itself is anything but brief. Clocking in at nearly six minutes, its length is justified by Uzi’s breathless vocal performance. We get every bit of what makes Uzi a superstar: the Philly-bred rapid-fire flow, his trademark sass and arrogance, a metaphor about being a jewelry-wearing octopus,“Naruto” references, and some half-sung vocals for good measure. The Dolan Beats-produced instrumental turns a sample from an anime soundtrack into a shimmering backdrop for Uzi to get absurd. Who could have predicted that the drawn-out final version of the song would be as rewindable as the preview?",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_6,2018,Pristine,Jenn Pelly,"“Pristine” begins as a humble indie-rock song before it blooms, brimming with the rawest feelings of youth. In just under five minutes, Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan chronicles the moment when innocence begins to turn into something else—the late-teens shift from feeling endlessly confident to seeing just how overwhelming emotions can really be. “Is there any better feeling than coming clean?” the 19-year-old sings, and it sounds like a great epiphany. Miraculously, Jordan embodies the clarity and ambition she sings of: “Pristine” has a scrappy spirit as well as polish, with a move towards virtuosity—shereallysings—that is rare in indie rock. “Pristine” carries hope; it feels genuinely new.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_5,2018,Pick Up,Noah Yoo,"Two chords and the perfect bassline can propel any party into the stratosphere. But DJ Koze doesn’t give it up from the jump. Instead, he begins with the ghostly outline of a rhythm. Then, a crystalline Gladys Knight sample peals above the noise, clear and cold. “It’s sad to think/I guess neither one of us,” she sings, “Wants to be the first to say goodbye.” The fuzz dissipates, and sweeping strings come into stark relief. Liftoff. “Pick Up” is a love letter to house music. For years, the track was a live staple for Koze, a genre agnostic who’s dedicated his career to cultivating vast knowledge of music and serving it up to audiences around the globe. What began life as a simple disco edit, built for live performance, revealed itself to be a testament to the power of the perfect loop, a dancefloor catalyst that Daft Punk or Chic could recognize and admire. Its pair of elemental, diametrically opposed samples—Knight’s melancholic voice alongside an uptempo break from onetime R&B hitmaker Melba Moore—blend together atop perfectly sequenced drums. “Pick Up” is a capsule of Koze’s musical mission: subtle reconfiguration of history in the quest of summoning bliss.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_4,2018,Nice for What,Ryan Dombal,"Ten years ago, Drake became a star with “Best I Ever Had,” in which he told a certain someone that she didn’t need to squeeze into a tight outfit and layer her face with makeup to look good. Amid a pop landscape swimming in misogyny, it sounded kind of sweet. But then, in the song’s Kanye West-directedvideo, Drake played coach to a basketball team of women with cartoonish curves and short-shorts, imploring them to “take that D!” and revealing his progressivism to be little more than a scam. But that was then. Drake’s latest ode to the opposite sex, “Nice for What,” is more believable. The song heavily samples Lauryn Hill’s “Ex-Factor,” a wrenching lament about manipulators who take their loyal partners for granted, as Drake rolls out verses that essentially tell women that they don’t need a guy like Drake at all. “That’s a real one in your reflection/Without a follow, without a mention,” he raps over a beat powered by New Orleans’ signature bounce style, offering a pep talk to independent women worldwide. In the video, helmed by young filmmaker Karena Evans, Drake is barely seen. Instead, famous and powerful women like Issa Rae and Yara Shahidi lead board meetings, study for college, and levitate. Is it all just pandering to the #empowerment era? Maybe. But the fact that one of the most self-possessed pop stars of our time is flipping the mirror away from himself feels like a victory in itself.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_3,2018,Malamente (Cap. 1: Augurio),Amanda Petrusich,"El Mal Querer, the second album from the Catalan singer Rosalía, is based loosely on an anonymous 13th Century Occitan poem about the psychic perils of jealousy, and what happens when love curdles into something uglier: panic about losing love. The single “Malamente” (the title roughly translates to “Badly”) mixes traditional flamenco rhythms with elements of pop, reggaeton, hip-hop, and R&B to create a sparse, pulsing hybrid. With this song, Rosalía somehow turns flamenco—which usually feels warm, flushed—into something chilling. The most transfixing thing about “Malamente” is her rich, fretful vocal; the song’s lyrics, sung in Spanish, are spooky, foreboding, dark. This is the sound, Rosalía seems to suggest, of love going wrong, and fast. She narrates a cascading series of bad portents: a broken crystal, a voice on the stairs, a gypsy, a dream about a bridge. Eventually, she comes to understand what’s at stake, and how important it is to get free: “I won’t waste even a minute on thinking about you again,” she promises.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_2,2018,Honey,Marc Hogan,"Robyn’s “Honey” was a myth before it ever truly existed. When an early version of the song aired during an episode of “Girls” last year, the Swedish pop star’s fans were left to imagine what the finished track would sound like; many expressed this via the playful online plea #ReleaseHoneyDammit. Later, Robynsaidshe’d worked on “Honey” longer than any other song she’d written. All this anticipation threatened to create unrealistic expectations for the track before it was even released. Instead, it turned out anticipation was the point all along. The title track from Robyn’s first solo album in eight years builds up so serenely, it snaps almost imperceptibly into focus. Drizzled in synth, pulsing like a heartbeat, “Honey” is where pop’s lovelorn dancefloor queen delivers ecstasy merely by promising it. The song overwhelms with glittery intimacy but keeps its own secrets. There’s a profound pleasure in hearing Robyn beckon, “You’re not gonna get what you need/Baby, I have what you want/Come get your honey.” With “Honey,” Robyn showed that pop, like real love, could be all about shared trust.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2018_1,2018,Love It If We Made It,Sam Sodomsky,"The 1975 were polarizing from the start. Revisit one of theirsleazily winking early videosor justread the long-winded title of their last album out loud, and it’s not hard to understand why. In the clip for their 2016 single “The Sound,” the Manchester pop quartet satirized their detractors, performing in a glass box while spectators grew bored outside of it, their critiques flashing onto the screen in big letters: “PRETENTIOUS. UNIMAGINATIVE. ANNOYING.” A sign of how the world has caught up with their relentless energy, “Love It If We Made It” turns the tables: Now we’re all in the glass box, and they’re defining us. Setting a whole feed’s worth of headlines, catastrophes, and memes to an industrial new wave rave-up, “Love It If We Made It” is the type of sing-along retrospective usually best left to award show montages and “SNL” season finales. It addresses police brutality, the prison industrial complex, the opioid crisis, and much more, as frontman and lyricist Matty Healy offers epitaphs both sweeping (“Modernity has failed us”) and specific (“Rest in peace Lil Peep”). With an anxious arrangement inspired by Scottish cult bandthe Blue Nile, the song connects culture and counterculture, internet and real life, past and present in a way that feels miraculously, temporarily united. Even when the words read like a list of jumbled trending topics—“Fossil fueling, masturbation, immigration, liberal kitsch, kneeling on a pitch”—the band’s urgency binds it together. Unpacking every reference becomes less entertaining than just standing back and watching the fireworks, as one headline explodes into the next. The beauty of “Love It If We Made It” is its fluidity, its weightlessness. It’s the sound of a band alternately thrashing against the world and rising above it. In the vocal performance of his young career, Healy sighs, growls, and screams, sounding just as helpless as any of us, raising questions only to watch them get buried by a thousand more. Few bands could have attempted something so audacious and made it sound so moving—a prolonged moment of desperate eye contact, shaped into a generational anthem.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2018,Pitchfork
2019_100,2019,If I Can’t Have You,Ryan Dombal,"Shawn Mendes seems beamed in from a pop era before face tattoos and pink hair and cursing: Last year, when the Canadian heartthrob revealed he liked to—gasp!—smoke weed, his squealing army of fans was appalled, with one of themadvising himto “think about going to rehab because we cant lose u like this. u are going to overdose and die.” But amid his chart peers’ rampant insolence, the 21-year-old’s tangy white funk slices through like a double rainbow. Take “If I Can’t Have You,” a sparkling single propelled by gargantuan Elton John piano chords and a glorious descending vocal line that should squeeze stress sweat out of Justin Timberlake. On paper, Mendes is pining after the girl who got away with the obsessiveness of an Instagram stalker—and yet his effervescent delivery, and shameless cheesing inthe video, make it clear that this winning rom-com of a song has a happy ending.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_99,2019,Fuck Dat,Arielle Gordon,"A deceptively sparse cut from Chicago stalwart DJ Nate’s first footwork record in nearly a decade, “Fuck Dat” is a fitting return to the genre: The steady clap of a snare drum recalls the style’s roots in ghetto house, while a meandering synth line hovers in the air, teasing the onslaught to come. But DJ Nate’s power is restraint: With a stream of warm TR-808 hits and a few errant hi-hats, he allows the footworkers who compete indizzying dance battlesto fill in the energy. The titular vocal sample, chopped into oblivion, is a suitable mantra: Nate returned to footwork while recovering from an injury that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, a particularly cruel irony in a scene defined by movement. But just because he’s notkilling a circledoesn’t mean he can’t give it new life.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_98,2019,13th Century Metal,Sheldon Pearce,"On “13th Century Metal”—the centerpiece of Brittany Howard’s debut solo album,Jaime—the leader of Alabama Shakes lays out a personal mission statement, her rock mantras on self-care and empathy building into the courage to denounce those “who are determined to keep us in the dark ages of fear.” The song reflects her search for optimism, with chants that grow in intensity as her inward resolutions become outward pleas for kindness. A potent juxtaposition of crashing noise music and pure ideals, “13th Century Metal” feels unconquerable, a maelstrom settling into place.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_97,2019,Claim It,Ben Cardew,"Perhaps the biggest shock on Klein’s latest album,Lifetime,is the appearance of a halfway conventional beat. Nestled among an album of brilliant—if sometimes exhausting—intensity, “Claim It” is a pause for thought as the South London producer peels back the sticky layers of her songs to reveal the textural skill beneath. What emerges is a strangled, melodic hook offset by unsettling vocal effects and chords that spiral upwards in a nervous twist of energy. Like a single malt whiskey with a drop of spring water, “Claim It” both dilutes and liberates Klein’s distinctive musical flavor, a reminder from this most maximalist of producers that less can occasionally be more.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_96,2019,Thinkin Bout You,Colin Lodewick,"If “Thinkin Bout You” is any indication, even after three years of marriage to her football-star husband, Ciara is still in the honeymoon stage. As she puts it: He’s a habit she can’t break; he’s her destiny. The exhilarating track from her seventh studio album,Beauty Marks, follows the singer in the throes of infatuation, with a throwback disco beat that mimics her joy. The song’s straightforward production matches the force of her emotions; little more than a simple beat, bassline, and backing vocals elevate her voice. It’s a rare, all-out work of pop from Ciara, and her voice glides over every line as she gives in to the force of her heart.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_95,2019,Get Well Soon,Colin Lodewick,"The heartbreaker and the heartbroken—aka the villain and the victim—are often the stock characters in songs about failing relationships. On “Get Well Soon,” Taylor Vick, the Oakland-based folk-pop singer who has performed as Boy Scouts for nearly a decade, chooses instead to look at how breaking someone’s heart can break yours, too. Singing over her lilting guitar, she makes it known that her decision is a compassionate act. There are no balloons, no condolence cards here; Vick knows that as bad as it feels, she can’t stay around to comfort someone who hasn’t treated her well.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_94,2019,It’s Up Freestyle,Alphonse Pierre,"Lil Keed is from the same Cleveland Avenue apartments in Atlanta as Young Thug. He has an eccentric and versatile ear for melody similar to Thug, and has even remixed his songs. But Keed is more than just another Young Thug clone. On “It’s Up Freestyle,” Keed perfects his high-pitched delivery, screeching and harmonizing over a beat from JetsonMade that sounds ready for a dystopian sci-fi movie. Whether he’s rapping at an inhuman pace or piecing together his ad-libs, whatever leaves Keed’s mouth is recitable: “Walked in, walked in, this Bentley truck you can crawl in,” he wails on a hook that’s since gone viral on TikTok. It’s that sugary delivery and his control that elevates the track into a standout in a city that has no shortage of hits.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_93,2019,Downhill Lullaby,Katherine St. Asaph,"Despitemany rumors to the contrary, Sky Ferreira didn’t sample the strings of “Bitter Sweet Symphony” on “Downhill Lullaby,” but hers did share that mood: a fatal swoon, something like the score of a David Lynch film. Their sound is shamelessly opulent and sumptuous with rot, like fruit losing its color but deepening in scent. If Ferreira’s previous albumNight Time, My Timechanneled ’90s alt-pop, “Downhill Lullaby” nods to the decade’s trip-hop with languid drums and bass, dank atmosphere, and a vague seediness. Ferreira’s vocals alternate from husky and over-heavy to lullaby-plaintive, then slide into the vulnerability that's marked her best songs. She sings about a relationship that’s not healthy yet no longer up for reconsideration; around her, the strings swoop and keen as if they're racing to the ground, too.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_92,2019,Incapable,Colin Lodewick,"Róisín Murphy begins “Incapable” as cheerfully as its disco-ready bassline suggests she will. The Irish dance-pop vet is ready to move, happy to feel wanted and free, even boasting that she’s never had a broken heart. But soon, the song’s steady groove and bright handclaps underpin a growing skepticism, as her perfectly intact heart begins to strike her as its own worrisome condition. “Am I incapable of love?” she asks herself. Though the song may be tongue-in-cheek, it highlights one of dance music’s core truths: Even a great beat can’t shield you from self-doubt.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_91,2019,Superbike,Philip Sherburne,"Nothing symbolizes freedom quite like the pairing of a motorcycle and open road. It’s a staple of American mythos; it’s the central conceit of Jay Som’s “Superbike.” Melina Duterte, who helms the project, is sparing with her imagery, piecing together the story as if from glimpses out a moving vehicle: hurt followed by hope, a two-wheeled escape, a painful memory. What she can’t fit into words plays out in the song’s swirl of major-key jangle, shoegaze fuzz, and tambourine, all churning like air currents. Betrayal may be the song’s fuel, but the overarching feeling is one of ease, unburdening, and independence regained.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_90,2019,placeholder,Stuart Berman,"Love and loss are twin pillars of songwriting, but there’s far less attention paid to the space in between: the relationships that last for three dates, the regrettable one-night stands, the rebound flings that never really had a chance. On the title track of their stellar second album, L.A.-via-Albany indieguitar heroMeg Duffy—a.k.a. Hand Habits—gives voice to the lovers left behind by non-committal types on the hunt for something better, as the song’s slow, Neil Young gait sets the pace for their fellow walking wounded. “I was just a placeholder, a lesson never learned,” they sing and sigh, like someone who’s grown all too accustomed to getting that “I think we should just be friends” text. For a remedy, they delve deeper into Youngian psychology, unleashing a series of pained fretboard squeals that sound like the guitar-solo equivalent of screaming into your pillow.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_89,2019,Office Rage,Jesse Dorris,"In the 1997 filmClockwatchers, an office temp pontificates on what work life has in store for her: “When I look ahead, I imagine infinite possible futures repeated like countless photocopies, a thousand blank pages.” In “Office Rage,” Philadelphia’s Control Top storm the cubicles and find that although the blank pages have been replaced by screens, the lethal ennui remains. “Staring at a screen/Makes me itch and scream,” Ali Carter yells. “Click click click click click/Makes me fucking sick.” A highlight of theirCovert Contractsalbum on Get Better Records—company slogan: “for the queers, by the queers”—“Office Rage” employs a network of guitar lines more tangled than a messy router and drums like someone kicking a vending machine to liberate a trapped bag of chips. But in this economy, it’s worker liberation Control Top is after. “Service with a smile? EAT SHIT!” Carter screams. It’s a sentiment all of us can believe in.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_88,2019,My Type,Michelle Kim,"Invoking 2000s nostalgia in a bid to create her own rap hit, Saweetie samples from a crunk classic: Petey Pablo’s Lil Jon-produced “Freek-a-Leek.” But instead of adopting Petey’s suave, come-hither vibe, Saweetie delivers “My Type” with bite: “That’s my type!” she yells, as if she’s just spotted a man at the other end of the club and she’s ready to take a swipe at any woman who dares approach him. Saweetie’s raucous energy falls in line with another generation of women in rap: Three 6 Mafia’s Gangsta Boo and Crime Mob’s Diamond and Princess, who were exhilarating to listen to because theyweren’tmeek, pleasant, or well-mannered. Against the throwback beat’s rumbling synthesizers that could get anyone on the dancefloor, Saweetie turns “My Type” into an anthem for women who want to be unabashedly loud.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_87,2019,Lover,Jamieson Cox,"There’s room in Taylor Swift’s galaxy for celebrity warfare, veiled political commentary, and enthusiastic allyship, but her work is finest when it’s laser-focused on flawed, hopeful people making a connection. “Lover,” the title track from her most recent blockbuster LP, is a reminder of how effortlessly she can translate specific gestures and moments into universal expressions of romance. With its rustic arrangement and domestic imagery, it sounds like a spiritual sequel to “New Year’s Day,” the acoustic cleansing that closes 2017’s divisiveReputation. Both songs are tributes to the dirty work that goes into keeping a relationship healthy, and they’re spiked with the fear and doubt people feel even when that work is paying off. How can you make sure a good thing lasts forever? “Lover” features a classically swooning, Swiftian bridge—one designed to soundtrack wedding vows in renovated barns until the end of time—but its most penetrating lines depict the unglamorous stuff: telling dirty jokes, saving seats, deciding whether or not to drag out the air mattress for your college friends. This is the stuff of real intimacy, of partnership, of creating a language and a life together. It turns out the woman who built a career on fairy tales and scorched-earth breakup songs is just as deft with the simple and soulful.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_86,2019,Bird,Olivia Horn,"As clichés go, “If you love someone, set them free” is textbook fare; making a memorable song out of it requires a certain magic touch. “Bird,” the emotional centerpiece of folk singer Azniv Korkejian’s second album as Bedouine, transforms that familiar conceit into a cinematic marvel. Backed by an orchestra that sounds plucked from Hollywood’s Golden Age, she sings with compassion and grace to a lover she likens to a bird she’s releasing from its cage. The contrast between the rhapsodic instrumentals and Korkejian’s stoic, heavy-lidded alto draws out the disparity between what is felt and what is said when lovers part ways. Bedouine’s heroine stares wistfully at the night into which her bird has flown off, the echoes of their final words implied by avian flute trills. You may have seen this ending before, but you’ll cry all the same.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_85,2019,Flyin’,Alphonse Pierre,"Teenage Atlanta rapper Duwap Kaine has been releasing lo-fi bedroom recordings on SoundCloud for about three years with little fanfare, and his music feels almost yawned out, dotted with Chief Keef-inspired Auto-Tune melodies, mumbled punchlines, and featherlight beats. A cartoon fever dream about getting high like a pilot, liking girls’ pics on IG, and the designer brands he wears while he glides through the streets of Georgia, “Flyin’” is the quintessential Duwap single. It’s hypnotic, effortless. On the song, he sounds like he’s wandering around in a daze, and his music is a perfect soundtrack for doing the same.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_84,2019,New Apartment,Michelle Kim,"Ari Lennox had to fight to put “New Apartment” onShea Butter Babybecause,she said, Dreamville label head J. Cole didn’t quite “understand” it. But Lennox thought it was the most important song on the album, because for a young woman like her, having her own apartment signifies safety and independence. On “New Apartment,” Lennox conveys this particular sense of freedom with a delightful string of images. Over a sample of Hubert Law’s soulful 1979 jazz composition “Land of Passion,” she sings about popping her “woo-hah in the sky,” drinking out of dollar-store wine glasses, and leaving her hair to clog the shower, all with the kind of sensual croon usually reserved for a romantic slow jam.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork

The record’s A-side, “Drømmen om Ø (Forever Mix ’19),” is a sumptuous, 14-minute mini-suite that lofts picturesque bird calls atop sleek drum pulse, rubbery acid synths, clattering Latin percussion, and other meticulously rendered subtleties. “Drømmen om Ø (Forever Mix ’19)” (the first part of the title translates to “The Dream of the Island”) is also a strange bird within Marott’s own Copenhagen techno scene.Forever Mixis thesecond releasefrom Kulør, the label run by fellow Danish artist Courtesy, following a compilation that introduced the city’s “fast techno” style. But the music here is slower-paced, introspective. “Drømmen om Ø (Forever Mix ’19)” may hit like a shock of tropical color against a gray city exterior, but it takes the length of an early-morning dream to achieve its blissful effects.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_82,2019,At the Party,Cat Zhang,"Pop stars slumped into nihilistic torpor this year, too paranoid and depressed to migrate from their beds to the dancefloor.Party? In this economy?they seemed to ask. But not all revelry equates with excess, even when the world is crumbling. In “At the Party,” Black Belt Eagle Scout’s Katherine Paul, a radical indigenous queer feminist, affirms the necessity of communal gathering for those who have suffered. The opening track of her second album,At the Party With My Brown Friends, it is Pacific Northwest indie rock at its finest—all quiet humming and watery guitar, mist and cold air—but it retains the redemptive quality of gospel. The central refrain lulls like gentle ocean waves: “We will always sing,” Paul murmurs. “We will always sing.” Her words drive home the power of music as refuge and even as self-defense. Sometimes what looks like a party is really salvation.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_81,2019,What’s the Move,Noah Yoo,"One of the most consistent sources of joy on Instagram in the past year has been Lil Uzi Vert’s feed, which serves as a running catalog of the rapper’s outfits. There’s something heartwarming about seeing the young talent—his sartorial tastes unbridled and his budget now virtually unlimited—take on looks that range fromResident Evilherotohypebeast Halloween ghoul. All of Uzi’s various flexes coalesce during his appearance on “What’s the Move,” a highlight from Young Thug’s albumSo Much Fun. Atop a bed of 808s and bird calls, Thugger’s yearning melodies set his Philadelphia counterpart up for a captivating (if all-too-brief) guest verse. “Flexin’ on these haters,” Uzi jeers, after rattling off all the designer labels on his person. “Richer than your first, richer than your last.” Success is the best revenge.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_80,2019,bmbmbm,Stephen Kearse,"Black midi traffic in beautiful convulsions, spazzing between rhythms, textures, and keys with a dexterity that’s so precise it’s dazzling, so fluid it’s showy. It’s tempting to take the quartet’s audacity as a challenge—to pop sensibilities, to listener patience—but it’s more rewarding to embrace their constant sense of wonder. On “bmbmbm” (pronounced “boom boom boom”), they are puckish and aloof, stacking oblique lyrics and a warped sample of a wailing woman over a calm bass riff and steady drumming. The resulting mood is placid but tense, like a flame meandering down a fuse. Energetic bolts of noise and percussion materialize from the sky and vanish just as quickly, disrupting the groove but not toppling it. As the song continues, these disruptions become more frequent, building to a tempest of discord that’s cathartic, indulgent, and kind of silly. But that’s the thrill of black midi: They’re as unsure of where the muse will lead them as the listener is.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_79,2019,Flood,Anupa Mistry,"Lætitia Tamko, who makes music as Vagabon,has saidthat “Flood” was initially written for another act to record. She described the process of creating for someone other than herself as “relief” from writer’s block, saying that there was freedom in that transference. The word “relief” implies a temporary state, a short break from a more permanent condition, but Tamko’s statement can also be seen as an acknowledgement of what creativity in 2019 looks like: at its best when untethered from the exhaustive rituals of self-promotion. “Flood,” which served as the introduction to Vagabon’s self-titled second album, diverges from previous Tamko recordings, which were rooted in the singer-songwriter’s melancholy croon and guitar playing. On the chorus of “Flood,” in the shadow of a drum machine and synthesizers that rise tall like futuristic oaks, Tamko’s voice embodies that modern-day creative isolation, taking on an almost robotic sheen.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_78,2019,NCAA,Sheldon Pearce,"2 Chainz’Rap or Go to the Leagueunpacks a long-held belief: The only two ways for some kids to make it out of the hood are to rap or play ball. The marching, Honorable C.N.O.T.E.-produced “NCAA” is the album’s centerpiece, detailing the rapper’s rise fromamateur ballerto pro rapper while taking on corruption in the sporting world. The song marks college players as victims of institutional suppression of opportunity, implicating the system as exploitative of the primarily black stars who earn billions in revenue for others. Untilrecently, the governing body that oversees college sports wouldn’t let student athletes profit in any way off their talents or likenesses, and 2 Chainz, a former player himself, weaponizes that hypocrisy into a rallying cry. Here, his flows are leisurely as usual but he sounds slightly perturbed, too, as if he can’t believe theunmitigated gallof it all. “NCAA” reinforces a fundamental 2 Chainz philosophy: Balling hard should be rewarded.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_77,2019,New Tribe,Philip Sherburne,"At first, Powder’s “New Tribe” looms ominously. The left-field techno anthem’s beat is reminiscent of Laurie Anderson’s “O Superman,” except here those slow, staccato exhalations sound more like the huffing of some titanic beast; the lumbering bassline might be its swishing tail. But a funny thing happens as the song continues its endless build: It pulls you in. What started out forbidding and impenetrable becomes a bubble you live inside. But that’s exactly the kind of thing Powderwoulddo. The Tokyo electronic musician is famous for lengthy, off-kilter DJ sets that disorient and envelop in equal measure. Here, she effortlessly flips the specter of colossal menace into a warm embrace.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_76,2019,Roses That Cry,Jayson Greene,"When you listen to a great punk song, you should be holding your breath a little, fearing for its survival. Empath’s “Roses That Cry” is so joyous and unsteady, so beautiful and compromised, that you feel compelled to pray for its existence immediately. The Philadelphia quartet’s anthem rises out of the center of their albumActive Listening: Night on Earthlike a thought bubble over the head of a cartoon character, hazy and unreal. “Remember when/That tree fell on your car?/Glass spilled/All over the yard,” warbles singer-songwriter and guitarist Catherine Elicson as the band collapses around her in streams of detuned synthesizers and guitars that sound like wind tunnels. She sounds positively serene.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_75,2019,One Sick Plan,Jenn Pelly,"Long Island native Jade Lilitri makes emo that could only exist in 2019. He draws from the rollercoaster hooks and blown-out emotion of his early-’00s Nassau County forebears, but strives to write, in his words, more “conscious” lyrics. That intention shines and crackles through “One Sick Plan,” the centerpiece of his third and best record,Basking in the Glow. Amid the rest of the album’s radiant gloss, “One Sick Plan” sounds like a hissy cassette demo, as if the sentiment—one of coming to see what really matters, like an epiphany—is so urgent and crucial that Lilitri had to release it straight away. His choppy acoustic strums seem to cut through a breeze, as he sings out to the person he cherishes: “Don’t sweep it under the rug.” Through all the self-doubt and pained longing Lilitri describes in this simple acoustic song, he has one sick plan to defy time: enduring love.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_74,2019,Room Temperature,Nadine Smith,"The hook of Faye Webster’s “Room Temperature” serves as a mantra for depressed millennials everywhere: “I should get out more.” Webster got started as the odd-one-out at Atlanta’s Awful Records, a singer-songwriter with a soft rock sound on a label mostly known for releasing rap, and she doesn’t exactly fit into a tidy genre either; her slightly soulful country-western style sounds more like ’70s FM radio than contemporary indie rock. “Room Temperature” exemplifies Webster’s lyrical specialty, that all-too-familiar summertime sadness, those late capitalism blues. Her voice expresses a gentle yet pervasive melancholy, but the swaying cymbals, woozy guitars, and lazy pedal steel keep you from sinking too deep into self-pity.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_73,2019,Meet Again,Marc Hogan,"Maxo Kream doesn’t glamorize. He doesn’t preach. He tells stories. With a reporter’s sense for detail and a matter-of-fact delivery, the rapper tells of lives marked by crime and poverty with gut-punching pathos and bleak humor. Those abilities were on striking display on his breakout album, 2018’sPunken; “Meet Again,” the lead-off single from this year’sBrandon Banks, take them to another level. Borrowing the epistolary conceit of Nas’ “One Love,” Maxo narrates a letter to an incarcerated friend. The song hits an emotional peak when the beat drops and Maxo starts talking about his own family, ripped apart by prison sentences and drug addiction.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_72,2019,Dumebi,Alphonse Pierre,"At the beginning of 2019, Rema was a teenager from Benin City, Nigeria, with a modestly viralfront-seat car freestyle. In the spring, he was at the top of the Nigerian charts. Released on the label of the powerful and enigmatic producer Don Jazzy, who also helped establish Afropop powerhouses like Tiwa Savage, Rema’s self-titled EP was composed of four tracks, each with a different sound—Juice WRLD-style trap, Young Thug-influenced melodies, and Afropop love ballads. But standing tall among them was “Dumebi.” “Dumebi” feels both traditional and new. The Ozedikus-produced rhythm is bouncy and fresh, while Rema injects the track with youthful energy and eccentric melodies. The times are changing in Nigeria, both politically and culturally, and the next generation of Afropop sounds like Rema.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork

The Long Island MC may haveverifiedthese fabrications, but his playfulness was obvious enough from the sound of things. Buoyed by an infectious hook, a sugar-cereal beat, and Tecca’s Auto-Tuned verses, “Ransom” is two glorious minutes of playing pretend.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_70,2019,Hurry on Home,Peyton Thomas,"Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownsteinhas likenedthe romantic disjointment in “Hurry on Home” to the breakdown of trust between government and citizens in our Trumpian epoch. It is, quite certainly, the horniest song of said epoch. The lead single fromThe Center Won’t Holdis a raw-throated howl of queer desire, shot through with angry, annihilative hunger. It is the sort of music about fucking that you make when your very right to fuck isunder attack: Brownstein and bandmate Corin Tucker sing about sex as a desperate leap into disembodiment. The fevered pulse of St. Vincent’s production blurs the jagged edges of Brownstein and Tucker’s twin guitars, making for an urgent undercurrent capable of driving listeners into each other’s arms. So long as Sleater-Kinney survives, no force on earth will stand between a woman, another woman, and their primal urge toU-Haul.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_69,2019,Home,Stuart Berman,"Home is an ambiguous concept for Dan Snaith: In his nearly two decades of music-making, the producer has dramatically reinvented himself on an album-by-album basis, veering from glitchy electronica to blown-out shoegaze to kaleidoscopic pop to subaquatic house without ever retracing his steps. So there’s a delightful sense of frisson when, on his first Caribou single in five years, we hear the sampled voice of ’70s soul singer Gloria Barnes declare, “Baby, I’m home.” It’s a statement that suggests a return to one’s roots, but “Home” doesn’t so much sound like Snaith’s earliest music as it does an alternate 2001 where he embraced the crowd-pleasing collagist aesthetic of the Avalanches and DJ Shadow instead of the cerebral beats of Four Tet and Boards of Canada. By conjuring a past he never experienced, “Home” once again takes Snaith somewhere he’s never been before.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_68,2019,About Work the Dancefloor,Anna Gaca,"Don’t get caught up on the seemingly faulty grammar of Georgia Barnes’ “About Work the Dancefloor,” a quirky electro-pop banger inspired by a weekend of club-hopping in Berlin. The unassuming lilt in the British percussionist/producer’s voice is enough to make the opaque title feel natural, as if she were interrupting her own train of thought. The single edit trims the song a bit; the best version appears on Georgia’s forthcoming albumSeeking Thrills, out in January, and gives room for her staggering intro to poke through the gleaming synths and stereo laser sprays. “I don’t have much in terms of money now,” Georgia admits as a thick, clubby bass drops, but on “About Work the Dancefloor,” she just wants to set us free.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_67,2019,sad day,Thea Ballard,"On the slow-burning “sad day,” FKA twigs alternates between a pining falsetto and a clenched, scratchy voice, full of regret. “Would you make a wish of my love?” she asks in the high voice, before dropping down and remembering the pain she caused in the past. The track, a jagged instrumental courtesy of twigs alongside producers Skrillex, Nicolas Jaar, Benny Blanco, and Noah Goldstein, fills in the space between these two modes of address—sweet entreaty, throaty self-recrimination. The refrain samples the British classic “It’s a Fine Day,” made famous in its 1992 rave rendition by Opus III, providing a moment of release from all the romantic tension and misguided hope.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_66,2019,Throne,Anupa Mistry,"Over the past two years, the young Jamaican artist Koffee has steadily risen through the ranks of the reggae-dancehall world thanks to the success of her pop-leaning single “Toast,” a track so massive it was recentlyperformed by a Chinese military bandto welcome the Prime Minister of Jamaica to Beijing. But “Throne” is Koffee’s true coronation song. Atop laidback horns, the 19-year-old delivers a performance steeped in the lineage of imaginative reggae-dancehall, particularly that of her mentor, Chronixx. She is a clever, urgent lyricist, constantly finding new pockets to play in. “A born storm, fire cyah calm,” she declares over a soundsystem-perfected bassline that will suit American festivals just fine.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_65,2019,I Need You,Ian Cohen,"The first half of this 10-minute track from DJ/producer Maya Bouldry-Morrison, aka Octo Octa, is rooted in gritted, lo-fi breaks, with vocals that drift on a reverbed vapor trail. They give ""I Need You"" the feeling of being suspended between two planes, its knees planted on the ground as its spirit drifts to the sky like a prayer. Then, six minutes in, the song finds its emotional anchor, as Bouldry-Morrison reads a buoyant note to her friends, her family, her listeners: “I love you! Thank you for being there. You mean so much to me.” It’s a deeply joyous moment.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_64,2019,Capacity,Vrinda Jagota,"Brooklyn synth-pop band Charly Bliss introduced their second album,Young Enough,with a glimmering, radioactive song that delights in blowing everything up. On “Capacity,” singer Eva Hendricks questions her tendency to put other people’s needs before her own while remaining empathetic towards her anxious, overachieving younger self. Rather than using boyfriends, endless work, or other people’s desires as a distraction, Hendricks decides to finally celebrate herself. The sound of this emotional resurrection is enormous: an explosion of buzzing synth, commanding drums, and gnashing guitar buoy Hendricks’ effervescent vocals. The ultimate irony of this song about a commitment to do less? The band’s ambition clearly shines through.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_63,2019,Pop Out,Evan Rytlewski,"Chicago rapper Polo G came up listening to local greats like Lil Durk and G Herbo, whose storytelling balanced titillation and tragedy. His own music is a logical evolution of their writing, even more vulnerable and irrepressibly sad. “Pop Out” was his breakout, the track that introduced his sorrow-stricken voice to the masses. Although it’s set against a backdrop of action—the robbery in the chorus is detailed with the kinetic precision of a Brian De Palma film—its real drama is internal, as Polo G processes the toll that playing the villain takes on your psyche. He may be the shooter, but in Polo G’s world, everybody’s a casualty. Telling his story, Polo G makes every word matter. It takes a special talent to rhyme “poverty” with “animosity,” and an even more special one to do it so casually that you don’t even really notice. That’s Polo’s great gift: His prose is intricate and purposeful, but it’s the emotion that lingers.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_62,2019,Aeroplane,Mark Richardson,"An airplane is a breeding ground for epiphanies—you’re floating above Earth and awed by the expanse, but you also feel distant and isolated and ultimately alone. It’s a place for remembering, for both running down regrets and allowing yourself to feel a bit of gratitude. That’s where Jessica Pratt finds herself here. “Aeroplane” is another entry in a long line of great songs set in the sky (think Joni Mitchell’s “This Flight Tonight” or Bill Callahan’s “Small Plane”), this one spurred by a reflection in the cabin window and an image of someone from her past, whose head she imagines wreathed in city lights. “I don’t wanna touch down,” she sings, musing over “treasures luminous and divine.” For three-and-a-half minutes, we’re up there with her.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork

It hurts and it's fabulous, this humiliation fantasy that begins with vocalist Laura Les calling you a “piss baby,” spitting and scream-singing through sheets of voice processing. Together with her fellow riot-starter Dylan Brady, Les crunches steel-wool bass and styrofoam guitars into something wonderful. 100 gecs seem to ask,What if you took everything you hated about yourself—all your insecurities about not being good enough or whole enough—and melted them down, jammed your boots in the sticky pit, and headbanged about it? Wouldn’t that feel like cash printed on demand?“money machine” is a purification ritual for the rotted-out brain, a seething, monstrous prayer to burn the slime away.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_60,2019,Love Without Possession,Thea Ballard,"Over the course of his last several albums, each a document of loss, Phil Elverum has become one of the most bracingly frank songwriters of our generation. On the first single from his sequel to the 2008 Mount Eerie albumLost Wisdom,he and collaborator Julie Doiron zoom out from the everyday minutiae of grief, excavating a broader-reaching poetics from blunt observation. “What glows beneath all the pain and anguish?” Elverum and Doiron ask in an asymmetrical call-and-response. The answer is love, of course. In this pair’s hands, love is an infinitely unruly concept, however concise their words and simple their musical arrangement, which doesn’t thicken much beyond the yawn of an organ and some distorted guitar. In his 2004 song “We Squirm,” Elverum characterized feelings as “captors” from which we’ll never be free. Here, love is rendered as a horizon, a void; it’s beautiful and it’s terrifying, and it goes on forever. And yet there’s comfort in hearing these two old friends return to one another to call this blazing thing forth.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_59,2019,Fashionista,Stuart Berman,"From Kraftwerk’s “The Model” to David Bowie’s “Fashion” to Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy,” pop music has always looked to the runway with an arched eyebrow. These are songs that playfully skewer the fashion world for its vanity and vacuity while secretly desiring to be part of it. (Surely it’s no coincidence that all of the above also function as tailor-made catwalk soundtracks.) Chai’s “Fashionista” belongs in this tradition, though the Japanese pop maximalists are less focused on supermodels than on the cosmetics consumers buy in attempts to look more like them. The song’s punky disco bounce is less an invitation to pose for the paparazzi than the soundtrack to a daily drill of skincare routines and make-up applications. But lead singer Mana isn’t about to accept her fate as a prisoner to the beauty industry: “Someone’s trend, it’s a shame!/Someone’s rules, it’s a shame!” she shouts in Japanese, transforming “Fashionista” from a lip-glossed pop jam into a revolutionary cry to stomp on your compacts in 4/4 time.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_58,2019,Anybody,Eric Torres,"A crown jewel among many on Burna Boy’sAfrican Giant, “Anybody” offers up an unrelentingly smooth exercise in realizing your own potential. The track’s fleshed-out sound, filled with bright horns, rapid clave rhythms, and a melodicinterpolationof Angélique Kidjo’s “We We,” suits the Nigerian star’s specific strain of prosperity gospel: If you have wealth, share it with your friends, he seems to say; and if you see others flaunting theirs, know that their comeuppance is around the corner. Like the smooth-talking “Ye” before it, “Anybody” finds Burna Boy operating at peak power, with his deep rasp and haughty delivery locking into an indisputable swagger. “Respect is reciprocal,” he declares, encouraging and upbraiding us at once.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_57,2019,Summer Girl,Jenn Pelly,"Haim released “Summer Girl,” their first single since 2017’sSomething to Tell You, on July 31, just in time to bottle the incandescent idea of late summer, when the season feels sweeter because its days are numbered. That sense of savoring small, perfect snatches of sun breezes through the song’s sax-flecked groove. It’s a minimal pop song with maximum levity, and if it feels like a balm, that’s because Danielle Haim wrote it for her partner (and Haim producer) Ariel Rechtshaid, who was battling testicular cancer at the time. Interpolating the “doo doo doo”s of Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side,” “Summer Girl” never builds to one solid chorus or drop, instead swaying into a sketch of a season’s magic hour, rolling on and on into the sunset.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_56,2019,Bromley,Noah Yoo,"When it comes to peak-hour dance tracks, there are crowd-pleasers that give the audience a perfect loop or breakbeat to sink their teeth into, and pivot tunes that give the DJ space to steer the night in new directions. “Bromley,” the first joint single by UK rave powerhouses Joy Orbison and Overmono, somehow manages to be both: a raw techno tool built atop relentless drum loops and a collage of intriguing sounds. Its mysterious, sampled vocal feels like a prism for a dancefloor’s energy, while moody ambience and electronic noise creeps through the cracks between drum hits. “Bromley” is a perfect fusion of Joy Orbison’s atmosphere and the thudding, percussive style of Overmono, and the results are delirious.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_55,2019,Freelance,Jonah Bromwich,"“Freelance,” the spiritual centerpiece of Chaz Bear’s sixth album as Toro y Moi, is the sort of catchy song that follows you—onto the subway, into the bathroom, into your dreams. Elsewhere on the well-namedOuter Peace, Bear says he’s “bad with the words,” but the lyrics here are worth chewing over. There’s the darkly ironic (“Freelance now, yeah I guess you earned it”), the adorably resigned (“No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals/I can’t tell if I’m hip or getting old”), and the strangely evocative (“You don’t know that you’re rust”). On the surface, “Freelance” may seem nonchalant, maybe even absurd, but there’s plenty going on here—and, given how much it burrows into your brain, it’s ultimately impossible not to notice.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_54,2019,Vossi Bop,Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,"Two years after Stormzy’s debut record lifted him from emergent grime talent to the all-around pride of London, the first single from his forthcoming second album took it back to the basics he built his name on. Best when he’s blustery, he took the raring energy of his early singles and channeled it into an extended brag concurrent with the vibe ofthe dance that inspired him. In it, he celebrates his success as a musician and activist while hearkening to the long tradition of dance-instructive tracks in the UK funky club scene that he’s drawn from. Stormzy's delivery is as stealth and cool as a Lamborghini in a foggy alley at night, further codifying his versatility as an MC and expressing the sweatless confidence of a newly crowned king.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_53,2019,Juice,Abby Jones,"Lizzo began 2019 as a cult favorite and ended it as a full-on industry darling. “Juice” wasn’t the hit that landed her at No. 1 for much of the fall, but the song’s irresistible throwback funk brought the singer-rapper into pop radio territory early on in the year, setting some groundwork for the big break to come. It’s an unapologetic introduction to Lizzo’s empowering strain of pop: If you don’t like the fabulosity before you, the song seems to say, then that’syourproblem. Pulling double duty as both a body-positive banger and a party bop, “Juice” obliterates inhibitions to the point that listeners’ insecurities become as insignificant as the not-so-single men sliding into Lizzo’s DMs.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_52,2019,Wasted Youth,Sam Sodomsky,"In the deceptively chipper “Wasted Youth,” Jenny Lewis lets us in on two sisters’ blacked-out, rock-bottom conversation about the recent death of their estranged mother, who was a drug addict during their childhoods. But if you ask Lewis about it, there’s a more innocent dependency at its core: “I feel like that song is more about Candy Crush than heroin,” sheexplained, “if that’s even fucking possible.” And indeed, during the breezy pinwheel of a hook, Lewis sings the name of the time-sucking iPhone game, letting those two words sum up the helplessness that haunts the song. As the folksy pop melody swirls, her words descend like so many colorful blocks on a screen. It’s a distraction—something to keep us entertained while everything falls apart—but that doesn’t mean it’s not real.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_51,2019,Starry Night,Philip Sherburne,"Whatever accounts for it—club culture’s ongoing fragmentation, some creeping suspicion that levity is bankrupt—dance music has been short on anthems in recent years. The South Korean producer Peggy Gou’s “Starry Night” summons revellers around a familiar gathering point: bright, bold piano chords, the tentpoles of summertime house classics ever since the music migrated from Chicago basements to Balearic terraces. To drive her point home, she offers up a chant that’s practically subliminal—one-word invocations of the ocean, starlight, pleasure, freedom,us. It’s a song about communion, an invocation of the very act of coming together, and an irresistible reminder of why we do.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_50,2019,Toyota Man,Marc Hogan,"Alan Palomo floated onto the indie scene a decade ago as the avatar of a sun-baked, synth-based movement that everyone soon begrudgingly agreed to call “chillwave.” Over the next several years, his Neon Indian project grew from warped-cassette daydream to wide-screen dance party. “Toyota Man,” Palomo’s first new song in three years, casts his music in fresh light by drawing out elements that were integral to his sound all along. Politics, humor, and Palomo’s Mexican-American identity were already latent in Neon Indian’s discography, but this warped Spanish-language protest anthem finally brought them all brilliantly to the front. The results feel more joyful than anyone in a time ofborder wallsandinternment campscould have expected. “Toyota Man” mixes endearing details (learning English fromThe Larry Sanders Show) with broad truths (“Todos somos Americanos,”or, as translated, “We are all American”) concoct a perfect celebration of his own immigrant experience—and, by extension, the American experience writ large.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_49,2019,Dark Web,Alphonse Pierre,"If you’ve ever woken up to see that Saks Fifth Avenue has charged thousands of dollars to your credit card, you probably won’t love Teejayx6’s brand of Detroit scam rap. On “Dark Web,” after the government bans Teejayx6 from using those sites, he responds by downloading a Tor Browser so he can get back in, obtains a VPN so he’s untraceable, and purchases aBINso he can once again go about his scams freely. The hyper-specific details—he makes it sound so easy that credit scams probably quintupled in the wake of this song—are what makes his music both seedy and improbably exciting. It’s the story of an underdog who just wants to scam a couple of unaware citizens and department stores so he can acquire some drip he can flex on IG: “I paid five thousand for my fit/ I’m not fitting in,” as he puts it. If you’re going to scam, at least make a catchy song about it.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_48,2019,ZORA,Olivia Horn,"“I do not weep at the world, I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife,” Zora Neale Hurston wrote in 1928. Her words, spiked with equal parts apathy, opulence, and menace, echoed in Jamila Woods’ mind as she worked on her second album,LEGACY! LEGACY!, a monument to black excellence. Like Hurston, the namesake of the album’s first single, Woods is something of a polymath: a singer-songwriter, poet, teacher, and activist. But on “ZORA,” she asserts that her selfhood is far more expansive than these labels, or any others thrust upon her, would suggest. “Little boxes you can’t stick unto me,” she sings, her vocals melting over a commanding backbeat. As if with a finger wag, she adds, “You will never know everything.” But there’s sweetness even in Woods’ venom, as when she taunts her foes by threatening to “tenderly fill [them] with white light.” It’s another nod to her multitudes: White light contains every color of the rainbow.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_47,2019,Door,Jillian Mapes,"Sometimes the difference between a good pop song and a great one lies in the sticky details:a borrowed bassline,a baby coo,the loop of a tumbi melody. Chairlift singer-songwriter Caroline Polachek, one of the first ’00s indie rock musicians to move intomainstream pop songwriting, surely knows this. On “Door,” her first single released under her own name, Polachek turns her malleable voice into a sing-song hook—“Back in the city/I’m just another/Girl in a sweater”—that scales up and down infectiously. Inspired by the slow-burning funk of Chic’s “At Last I Am Free” cover, Polachek takes her time unfolding the details surrounding that small realization. Atop sparse beats and a hazy guitar, she sings poetically about the wave of self-actualization that hits after the end of a long-term relationship, noting that “the door slams hard behind you when you leave the house of judgement.”",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_46,2019,Eye in the Wall,Laura Snapes,"To hear him tell it, Mike Hadreas has a terrible relationship with his body. He has Crohn’s disease, and he’s repeatedly expressed the desire to transcend his own fleshy form. Yet over four fearless albums, his physicality has occupied an ever-greater part of his work. InThe Sun Still Burns Here, a dance piece from Hadreas and Seattle-based dancer Kate Wallich, it becomes the totality: One preview described part of the performance as “essentially a fully clothed orgy,” for which Hadreas both composed the score and performs as a dancer. On “Eye in the Wall,” the first song released from the project, he commands fragmented images of a body to become whole, “wild and free,” leaving him “full of feeling…full of nothing but love.” He issues these instructions in a louche warble, his twang and metallic shimmer gathering into a nine-minute reverie of Afro-Latin percussion and searing, silvery brightness that captures the incandescent feeling of physical abandon.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_45,2019,NASA,Anna Gaca,"NASA, probably the only popular U.S. government agency left, was everywhere this year: T-shirts and patches bearing its charmingly retro insignia became abona fide trend, and Ariana Grande pulled its name for a sneaky sleeper hit fromthank u, next.On an album largely about the joys of being unattached, “NASA” offers a nuance: the freedom to be attached, just not right now. “I can’t really miss you if I’m with you,” Grande offers, gently reminding a lover that intimacy doesn’t mean constant proximity. While Grande’s refrain of “I’m a star, I’ma need space” verges on cutesy, the delicate harmonies and airy production of “NASA” make its blown-out bass and trap drums feel weightless.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_44,2019,RICKY,Cat Zhang,"Denzel Curry blazed a trail forSoundCloud rap—that gritty, bass-boosted sound that reverberated around South Florida and elevated its young practitioners into rock stars. But despite his fame, he’s grown up with his head screwed straight. The rapper pays tribute to his father on “RICKY,” handing down paternal pillars of advice—trust no one but your family, stick up for your day-ones, respect women like you would your mother—to his followers, some of whom started out doubting him. The directives are austere, but a slowed-down sample of the British electronic producer Lukid’s “Twisted Blood” infuses the song with life. “RICKY” clanks and bounces, as if an airplane climbing toward higher altitudes has just hit turbulence.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_43,2019,Pissy Pamper,Sheldon Pearce,"Even without an official release, “Pissy Pamper” was irrepressible. Left off Young Nudy’sSli’merredue to sample-clearing issues, the song has lived a full life in corners of the internet—uploaded, taken down, then uploaded again, sometimes as only one verse or an instrumental, sometimes under the name “Kid Cudi.” (The real Cudiapproved.) The sparkling, Pi’erre Bourne-produced oddity has spawned countlessfreestylesandremixes, becoming a little phenomenon on its own. Nudy proves a capable leading man, and few rappers sound more untroubled while detailing how they evade cops, but it’s his song in name only: Playboi Carti dominates with his spectacular, baby-voice verse. Only Carti is better at navigating Bourne’s circus beats than Nudy—they’ve both had more practice than anyone—but here, they prove they work best as a team. Nudy is a perfect sidekick, Carti is a born star, and Bourne is the most daring rap producer working now. Even as a leak, this is the new benchmark for the SoundCloud rap elite.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_42,2019,Stay High,Allison Hussey,"Brittany Howard doesn’t specify whether the buzz she seeks on “Stay High” is internal or external, whether she wants her effervescence from emotional intimacy or a fat joint. It doesn’t matter—the song is light and loose enough to capture both. Howard creates a space for luxuriating in the company of another person, sharing a private escape from the downcast grind of everyday life. Her smoky croon does the heavy lifting: the way she draws out and sinks into the phrase “I’m doing wonderful, just fine, thank you” feels like the deep, full-body stretch that comes after a satisfying afternoon nap. “I already feel like doing it again,” Howard sings on the track's opening line, and her easygoing warmth makes ""Stay High"" worth repeating.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_41,2019,Welcome to the Party,Alphonse Pierre,"There’s no greater honor in New York City than having the song of the summer. Past anthems like Bobby Shmurda’s “Hot Nigga” and Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” are immortal, and now Pop Smoke’s “Welcome to the Party” can be added to that list. Like Bobby and Cardi, it happened fast for Pop Smoke: At the start of 2019, he was an unknown with only a singleremixto his name. Four months later, “Welcome to the Party” dominated the city’s airwaves and guided Brooklyn drill music beyond New York’s state lines. His voice was almost preposterously deep for his age, like some kind of mysterious cartoon villain, and mixed with the haphazard, bass-heavy production, the song transformed Brooklyn into a dystopian playground. His was a swagger that couldn’t be imitated, though people tried from every rooftop, apartment window, and car door.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_40,2019,In Your Head,Aimee Cliff,"Part of London singer-songwriter Nilüfer Yanya’s early appeal was her deadpan, detached cool. Airy melodies seemed to drift out of her like breath. But her debut album,Miss Universe, challenges the idea that anyone should be so poised, and on the guitar-thrashing “In Your Head,” she dazzlingly loses her shit. While the verses move slow, with half-spoken lyrics shrugged into wide-open space, the choruses build like a panic attack, anguished and ferocious. The track is a perfect expression of a distinctly modern anxiety: being stranded in a place with no cell signal, dying to know what’s going on in someone else’s head. From the creeping intensity of the glimmering background synth to the perfectly imperfect way her voice skids when she hits the high notes, Yanya encapsulates the explosive tantrum feeling of not being able to reachorread someone, when in theory we should have their thoughts at our fingertips. It's a song perfect for 2019, but with a rock backbone that would go just as hard in any year.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_39,2019,747,Madison Bloom,"When Bill Callahan returned with his first record in six years, he did so as a father. This new role of family man shaped his albumShepherd in a Sheepskin Vestsignificantly. On the standout ballad “747,” Callahan contemplates the unspoiled gaze of a newborn baby, likening it to the view from an airplane. While much of Callahan’s earlier catalog is tied to specific, isolated characters, “747” casts a wider glance, marveling at the splendor of birth and parental love. As he sits by the titular airplane’s window, “flying through some stock footage of heaven,” he compares the celestial sight to an infant’s purity. “This must be the light you saw/That just left you screaming,” he sings over sweetly plucked guitar. “And this must be the light you saw/Before our eyes could disguise true meaning.” He is certain that we lose this vision in time, each year getting further from that light. But, Callahan argues, we are doing the best we can. “747” is not a criticism of our transformation from wide-eyed infants to weary elders, but a tranquil acknowledgement of its inevitability.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_38,2019,Hello Sunshine,Matthew Strauss,"OnWestern Stars, a Springsteen album full of character studies, the protagonist of “Hello Sunshine” may be the one who most resembles the man himself. It’s a cinematic country ballad about being left alone with your loneliness, still roaming the empty streets but now searching for hope there. Springsteen has been open about his lifelong battle with depression, and “Hello Sunshine”—with its warm pedal steel, serene strings, and nostalgic piano chords—sounds like him trying to hang on to a happy moment.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_37,2019,Only Human,Noah Yoo,"Four Tet’s “Only Human” started life as a dancefloor edit of Nelly Furtado’s “Afraid,” the opening track from her now-iconic 2006 albumLoose. As Four Tet describes it, he happened to hear the original song and began working on it almost as a lark, layering Furtado’s vocals and locking them into sizzling hi-hats and knocking percussion. His rework quickly made its way from DJ to DJ (as these unofficial edits tend to do), appearing in sets by Peggy Gou, Ben UFO, and others, before finally being officially released this March. The track itself is minimalist brilliance, but the song’s origin story and its dancefloor potency are what makes it such a compelling listen. Thank goodness that sample cleared.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_36,2019,What Happens to People?,Evan Minsker,"In the debate over whether it’s better to burn out or fade away, Deerhunter leader Bradford Cox doesn’t take sides. In the frail centerpiece of the band’sWhy Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, he simply prods at the multiple ways humans give up, decay, and vanish. As a narrator, Cox expresses a kind of numb acceptance, and the scenery he offers—the rotting houses and rusted engines—are as bleak and beautiful as the song’s sweeping pianos and gentle guitar licks. Though “What Happens to People?” was recorded before the death of former Deerhunter bassist Josh Fauver late last year, the loss can’t help but hang like a specter over this song about the inevitability of life’s end.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_35,2019,People,Ryan Dombal,"For their latest warning about the end of the human race, relentlessly self-aware genre agnostics the 1975 turn to a style that many—including the band itself—have deemed extinct: rock’n’roll. “People” is powered by a screeching lead guitar line that pierces like a nuclear alarm, drums loud enough to rev up a bloodthirsty gladiator arena, and frontman Matty Healy’s panicked screams, seemingly delivered from the center of a rapidly melting ice cap. Healy wrote the lyrics while touring the American South earlier this year, around the time Alabama signed a draconian anti-abortion bill into law, and he shows the most desperate kind of gallows humor: “The economy’s a goner, republic’s a banana, ignore it if you wanna.” The song is both a wake-up call and an admission of defeat—a balls-out strut to be played for the indifferent masses as the world burns.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_34,2019,True Blue,Madison Bloom,"You know it’s been a rough year when the man behind “Uptown Funk” makes an album of breakup songs. Mark Ronson’s most recent LP,Late Night Feelings,is full of sad dance tracks that mix glitter with broken glass, and none cut as deep as the Angel Olsen feature “True Blue.” Olsen sings like the final patron at a bar, crooning just loud enough to tell her sob story over the blaring jukebox. It’s unclear if anyone’s listening, but that makes it all the more tragic. The funky bass riff and disco drums mock her distress, setting the scene for a dance where our heroine has no partner: “I ran to you and you know why,” she shouts at the empty barstool next to her. “True Blue” is the sound of taking your heartache out for a night on the town—you might be able to sedate it with booze and loud music, but you will wake up in its arms the next morning.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_33,2019,The Barrel,Stephen Deusner,"On “The Barrel,” Aldous Harding says a lot but gives away almost nothing. Riding a steady current of crisply picked acoustic guitar and rippling piano, the song is crammed with references to ferrets and eggs, doves and nuts, peaches freshly harvested and hands reaching out of barrels. The imagery is familiar, yet the New Zealand-born/Wales-based artist deploys it in a way that makes these everyday objects sound off-kilter and foreign, like signs held askew to point in a direction few have traveled. She arranges the song—a standout on her third album, the folk-pop gemDesigner—so it builds gradually, adding new elements that subtly reshape its flow. As always, Harding fashions her own unique mythology but remains evasive about its precise meaning; perhaps she doesn’t write to confess, but to pose uneasy questions.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_32,2019,Cattails,Jazz Monroe,"Big Thief’s most resonant music keys into a sweeping modern dread—namely, that tech expansion and the ecological crisis have orphaned us from nature, maybe from part of our soul. “Cattails” proposes that music can bridge that gulf: between our modern and past lives, between the conscious and unconscious realms, and between our daily routines and the unarticulated terror burbling underneath. With a keening croak and hearty 12-string, Adrianne Lenker traverses this liminal space in great strides, implicating beauty, fear, plant life, and human death in a vast spiritual conspiracy. Lenker sings of her late great-grandmother over cyclical strums, insisting that the river of time, like a bottomless melody, can only lead us home.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_31,2019,Sympathy,Matthew Schnipper,"What happened to Vampire Weekend? After the departure of core member and baroque multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij, the usually chipper and concise indie rock band recordedFather of the Bride, a very long, exploratory album. “Sympathy” is the surprise highlight. Sometimes the song is sublimely funky; sometimes it feels designed to make your stomach gurgle. Until three minutes in, it’s a wiggly little thing, its cha-cha beat working double-time as frontman Ezra Koenig coos like a sexy villain. But when the drums kick in for the final 45 seconds, they introduce an explosive wall of sound that’s as urgent as an air raid siren. After years of buttoned-up tastefulness, the band seems to be creeping into enemy territory here.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_30,2019,Time Flies,Rawiya Kameir,"It was easy to submit to rage this year; there was good cause all around. Mercifully, Rico Nasty returned with her dynamic brand of catharsis, smashing through walls like a pint-sized Kool-Aid Man.Anger Management, her collaborative project with the producer Kenny Beats, was released just as spring arrived, but by summer, Rico seemed to have gotten fight music out of her system. In July, she dropped “Time Flies,” a Dee B-produced loosie that appears on theMadden NFL 20soundtrack. Ironically, the song sounds more like the brief, intoxicating respite that comes after scream therapy than the dyspeptic fury you’d expect of anything associated with the NFL. Sparkly, melodic, and ultimately optimistic, “Time Flies” recalls the treacly, animated energy of Rico’s early days. As the beat bubbles and then strikes, she catalogs her pain; there is loss, fear, undeserved hate. But even as the reasons for Rico’s anger persist, her own attitude helps spur transformation: “Got tired of complaining/I got up and changed my situation,” she sings. As summer turned into fall, that sentiment proved just as useful as her anger has been.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_29,2019,Daylight Matters,Arielle Gordon,"Cate Le Bon finds the beauty in isolation. On “Daylight Matters,” from her delightfully eccentric fifth albumReward, she spins repetitive, circuitous speech patterns into delicate bridges and euphoric choruses. “Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you,” she sings, her wistful voice foreshadowing the twist: “But you’re not here.” The lilting vocal gives off the impression of talking to yourself, the sort of compulsive self-soothing that springs up in seclusion. The melancholy is a reflection of Le Bon’s environment: She composedRewardin the near-solitude of England’s mountainous Lake District. Cloaked in dreamy synths and rounded saxophone, “Daylight Matters” hints at glam rock’s bravado while retaining Le Bon’s characteristic playfulness. It’s as if we’ve been let into her colorful interior world, witness to the elaborate orchestra she’s constructed to fill in the empty space.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_28,2019,Andromeda,Sam Sodomsky,"In the early weeks of 2019, Natalie Mering shared a subtly disorienting video for “Andromeda,” the first single fromTitanic Rising, her masterful fourth album as Weyes Blood. The song itself is all sweeping Laurel Canyon haze: a hook that’s almost entirely pedal steel guitar and a sad, swooning vocal delivery that seems coated in FM static. While her music has felt increasingly connected to classic rock radio, this song—with its analog hum and open road grandeur—signaled a deeper inquiry into what’s soclassicabout those old standbys. The video, however, looked more like a Y2K-era screensaver on a desktop computer: a steady, slightly pixelated flow of distant stars in an endless black sky. This melding of our recent and distant pasts is crucial to Mering’s songwriting; she moves forward by studying where we’ve been, rendering it both familiar and somewhat uncanny.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_27,2019,"Hey, Ma",Stephen Deusner,"Two-and-a-half minutes into “Hey, Ma,” the music fades to silence, the song grows calm, and Justin Vernon’s voice emerges almost naked, mostly free of the effects that have colored his vocals since 2007’sFor Emma, Forever Ago. It’s a powerful moment: one of the most influential musicians of the 21st century stripping everything away so he can sing directly to you. The words might sound unsettled and unspecific—something about waiting outside, going into a room, learning the truth—but he’s always made a virtue out of impressionistic lyrics. This is a song less about communication than connection: Who keeps you grounded? Who pulls you out of the coal mine and into the real world? Over time, Vernon expanded Bon Iver to include a small town’s worth of musicians andeven a dance troupe, and together they’ve created a rousing arena anthem suitable for the ambitious tour they launched earlier this year. “Hey, Ma” wants you to get those lighters up—or your phone or your hands or whatever—and join in.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_26,2019,Dirty Laundry,Stephen Kearse,"On any given night in America, there is an open mic event where a green comedian jokes about paying strippers with change and inevitably uses the phrase “making it hail.” No one laughs. On “Dirty Laundry,” being a broke, horny schmuck is the setup instead of the punchline, and Danny Brown kills. He recounts awkward drug sales, a hookup in a Burger King bathroom, and two encounters with a stripper: as a client and as a fellow patron at a laundromat. Skeevy and giddy, he makes the gutter sound like a theme park. Brown has been telling offbeat stories his entire career, and Q-Tip’s bouncy production—a funky drip of beeps, gurgly synths, and stretched vocal samples—accents his poise. The rapper sounds at ease over this colorful backdrop, his laundry-themed wordplay as loose and entertaining as it is technical. These gonzo escapades lack the teeth-chattering urgency of Brown’s previous music, but ultimately, his dirty-uncle act comes across as relief. He’s a full showman here, his bits polished, his delivery smooth. Most acts don’t mature this well.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_25,2019,Ashes to Ashes,Laura Snapes,"Jenny Hval’s work is always moving closer to the essentials: pleasure, creativity, nurture; reproduction, death, survival. Again and again, she ventures into dank places and emerges with observations that are striking for their lucid originality and humor. On “Ashes to Ashes,” she tills the sediments of sex, art, and mortality, dragging ash from a cigarette into a grave and equating penetrating fingers to the double-digit swipe of a phone screen to a frantic drowning kick. The song takes place in a dream and preserves dream logic, psychologically cogent yet somehow logically inexplicable. Hval threads it together with a trance pulse that buffets these ideas across the wake-sleep divide like marbles in a Newton’s cradle. Yet it’s featherlight: Hval’s euphoria and divine hooks transform scholarly thought into pure pop.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_24,2019,All Mirrors,Amy Phillips,"Angel Olsen has always been difficult to pin down, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an otherworldly warble and gut-punching lyrics. She has spent her career shapeshifting between genres and personas, from solo folkie to barnstorming indie bandleader to Mark Ronson- collaborating pop singer. On “All Mirrors,” the title track of her latest album, Olsen introduced her latest (and perhaps greatest) incarnation: mighty goth sorceress. The song unfurls like the train of a black satin wedding gown, undulating on a bed of sinister, classic-Hollywood strings and subtle synth pulses. Olsen intones ominously about lost beauty, being buried alive, and repeating the past, building to the kind of cathartic climax that demands to be shouted from a windswept cliff in a fierce rainstorm (preferably while wearing the elaborate bejeweled headpiece from the song’s strikingmusic video). With that, we are thoroughly under her spell.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_23,2019,Running,Billie,"“Running” opens like a dream: Ambient noise buzzes into focus, as singer-songwriter Roberto Carlos Lange’s soft, layered croon fades in and holds us close. The fragmented story that unfolds against crisp, quiet hi-hats and warm piano chords has a nostalgic quality, though it’s hard to know if Lange is acknowledging someone from his past, present, or future. “I feel you/In my mind/All the time,” he sings with care, revealing the kind of love he feels: implicit, unconditional. When he delivers the chorus—which features the word “running” repeated eight times—it feels like a meditation of gratitude. Then the song fades away, leaving you a little lighter than before. –Braudie Blais",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_22,2019,hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it,Sam Sodomsky,"In 2019, Lana Del Rey doesn’t have to explain why she considers hope to be a dangerous thing, but what does she mean by “a woman like me?” How does one of the decade’s greatest pop music enigmas define herself? In the piano-ballad closer ofNorman Fucking Rockwell!, she offers a few clues: She finds inspiration from Sylvia Plath and photographer Slim Aarons. She’s not quite happy but she’s definitely not sad. Because the arrangement never picks up—it’s just Jack Antonoff’s muted piano, his pauses as loud as the chords themselves—Del Rey pushes the dynamics with her vocal delivery, building to a whispered falsetto as affecting as any of her most elaborate crescendos. Once upon a time, listening to her music meant scouring all the references and layers to find the reasons for the apocalyptic dread in her voice, the slow-burning romance in her melodies, the nostalgic haze of her videos. On “hope is a dangerous thing,” she lays the mystery bare, looking directly into our eyes and telling us what she sees.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_21,2019,Gretel,Abby Jones,"In the Brothers Grimm fairytale “Hansel and Gretel,” a young brother and sister are lured into a house made of sweets by a child-eating witch. Eventually, Gretel pushes the evil creature into an oven, frees her caged sibling, and the pair escape. Philadelphia bedroom-pop hero (Sandy) Alex G’s abstract update of the story, a highlight from his albumHouse of Sugar, is decidedly darker: Gretel leaves her brother behind and ends up consumed not by the misdeed, but by her own twisted desire to return to the candy-coated lair. The song's mix of sped-up and untreated vocals suggests its namesake's split psyche, while its ominous main guitar riff is constantly brushing up against more whimsical musical flourishes. With all of its juxtapositions, “Gretel” is a small study in reworking age-old concepts to fit into our troubling present.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_20,2019,Suge (Yea Yea),Sheldon Pearce,"The core of DaBaby’s gauntlet-throwing year, “Suge” is one of 2019’s most fun and infectious hip-hop songs, putting on display the rapper’s signature bounce and his almost goofy, browbeating nature. His talky flows scan as bar-heavy despite most of his raps being filler, simply because their ferocity can raze beats to cinders. Invoking the name of the strongman turned Death Row Records boss Suge Knight, Da Baby’s breakout single is all about graduating from thug to kingpin but still being ready to put hands on fools—or, you know, dangle them off of a balcony (allegedly) if need be. He runs rampant, bullying, threatening, and coercing his enemies, his claims brought to life by his bum-rushing delivery. The song made clear that DaBaby was wound up and raring to go before he exploded this year, and no one has stopped him yet.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_19,2019,He,Anupa Mistry,"In 2011 and 2012, the British singer-songwriter and producer Jai Paul released two singles that caught the attention of everyone from the then-active music blogosphere to Drake. After a mixtape’s worth of unfinished music was leaked in 2013, Paul basically disappeared for the next six years, establishing himself as a reclusive mad genius. But in June of this year, Paulre-emerged, releasing an official version of the leak and two new songs: “He” and “Do You Love Her Now.” “He” begins with fast strokes like “Bootylicious” before Paul’s signature funky guitar and pillowy whole notes emerge. The track carries the Prince allusions often ascribed to Paul—clanging synths only enhance the ’80s flavor—but there’s a new earnestness to the song that becomes apparent toward the bridge. Paul’s voice breaks away from all affect, and it sounds as though we’re hearing him sing into the booth through the talkback button in a studio’s control room, unadorned and unmic’d. It sounds like he’s finally free.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_18,2019,Old Town Road,Matthew Schnipper,"“Old Town Road,” inarguably the most popular song of 2019, might not have reached such a level of cultural saturation were it not for the commotion around its expulsion from Billboard’s country charts, a dubious move that sparked warranted accusations of racism. But whether the song is country or rap is irrelevant; “Old Town Road” doesn’t just transcend genre, it transcends music altogether. It came out of nowhere, two minutes of pure joy made by a guy whose previous claim to fame was rumoredly running aNicki Minaj-stanning Twitter account. The song’s beat samples Nine Inch Nails, which you’d never know, and the lyrics, loosely about riding horses, are crooned with effortless confidence. The finished product is a weird-as-hell blast of serotonin. Admittedly, you can’t take hits of sunshine all day, every day, so it’s possible that your need to incessantly hear “Old Town Road” has waned. Mine hasn’t. Years from now, when time has laid waste to my body, I will still whisper my personal Rosebud: “Wrangler on my booty.”",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_17,2019,Snow Is Falling in Manhattan,Sheldon Pearce,"David Berman was a peerless songwriter and poet with a gift for squeezing expressive scenes out of seemingly ordinary language. In “Snow Is Falling in Manhattan,” he turns a brownstone into a snow globe, his ragged voice rumbling over gentle guitar and drums. His portrait of a bitter New York winter couldn’t be any warmer: The frigid world outside is undercut by hospitable gestures, from a caretaker salting an icy stoop to one friend shielding another with an afghan. The images are breathtaking in their simplicity and beauty. The caretaker isa metaphorfor Berman’s role as a singer, and he treats that responsibility with reverence. The lyric about being “a host who left a ghost” behind feels even more poignant after Berman’s death this year, as every utterance remains familiar and inviting, ushering you in from the cold.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_16,2019,Drunk II,Noah Yoo,"To listen to Mannequin Pussy’s Marisa Dabice sneer, cry, wince, and roar her way through “Drunk II” is to step into her shattered psyche. She sings with a ferocity rarely heard in the easy-listening playlist bait of modern indie; her presence practically makes the entire band vibrate. “Do you remember the nights I called you up?” Dabice asks her former lover. “I still love you, you stupid fuck.” There is joy here, too—in every muscular snare fill, every noisy pick drag, every note of the guitar solo at the song’s apex. At that point, Dabice splits in two—her internal dialogue goes to the left channel as her newly courageous external self moves to the right. “I push you down, I drink, you drown, I am alone,” she sighs, as her other side boasts, “Everyone, gather ’round, I have the answer now.” “Drunk II” expresses the push and pull of love and hate, and how we’re all surrounded by other people just trying to figure it out.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_15,2019,Free Uzi,Alphonse Pierre,"It’s been two long years since Lil Uzi Vert’sLuv Is Rage 2, and all we’ve had to hold us over is leaks, label drama, and the occasional Instagram fit pic. But for one moment, Uzi slipped free of the grip of Generation Now label heads Don Cannon and DJ Drama with “Free Uzi.” Over a classic DJ L drill beat, Uzi explodes for three minutes of bars that feel like ablurry 2000s Philly freestyle—probably featuring Meek Mill with fuzzy cornrows—that you would find in the deepest corners of YouTube. It’s a peek at the direction in which Uzi’s rap is headed, raising his pitch and unveiling his take on the baby voice popularized by Playboi Carti. And truly, Uzi is the only rapper that could confess on record to being a loyal viewer ofThe Big Bang Theoryand still have it slap. Free Uzi forreal.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_14,2019,Motivation,Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,"It may not have been intentional that Normani’s first solo single after the dissolution of Fifth Harmony shares the effervescence of Beyoncé’s 2005 bop “Check on It,” but it was definitely subliminal: Like her Houston sister, here was a former girl-grouper stepping out on her own, eager to show the world her talent after a half-decade of performing as a cog in that system. Normani breezed through the track, co-written by Ariana Grande, with the confidence of an artist who knows her worth, and further stamped her star power with the stunningly gymnastic choreography in its video. Both song and video contain the brassy essence of pop R&B’s early-2000s glory days, an innocent coquettishness and pure joy in hitting the dance floor—and in paying homage to that era, Normani hit a hard reset on her career trajectory, proving that she was always more formidable than she’d gotten credit for.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_13,2019,Lark,Jillian Mapes,"On “Lark,” the opening track fromAll Mirrors, Angel Olsen once again surveys how men and women in love struggle to see each other clearly. She expands an idea from 2016’s “Heart Shaped Face”—that baggage dragged from relationship to relationship is too heavy to bear—into a high-stakes epic, the first of her songs that could legitimately shock you. She begins tenderly, but about a minute in, she starts hollering as if from the top of a mountain. Even once Olsen turns gentle again, the string arrangement simmers with dread—there is some kind of explosion coming, the song warns us, before it arrives, spectacularly. “Told me that I was the woman/He’d always be losing, always be dreaming,” Olsen says just before everything erupts. “What about my dreams?” she screeches, sounding like so many ambitious, fed-up women before her.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_12,2019,Cash Shit,Rawiya Kameir,"As a joint thesis statement from two of rap’s biggest breakout stars, “Cash Shit” is almost suspiciously on-the-nose. Megan Thee Stallion and DaBaby—both witty Southerners with distinct if borderline-conventional rap styles—seize the Lil Ju beat as a stage. The production booms and yet is barely there, and actually elevates their vocals. The pair delivers some of the year’s most-recited lyrics: Megan’s capitalist-feminism (“Yeah I’m in my bag but I’m in his too”) was inescapable, both as a club staple and as a trending social media philosophy. DaBaby, as 2019’s reigning steal-your-girl lothario, made for plenty of Instagram captions, too. But even in its ubiquity, “Cash Shit” didn’t get old—arguably, in part, because Megan and DaBaby both rap about sex like they have plenty of it, a transcendent feat among their peers who’ve been clouded in a low-libido haze. Two much-hyped music videos were subsequently abandoned, making it quite clear: The song itself is plenty.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_11,2019,Binz,Anupa Mistry,"“Binz” is a one-minute-and-51-second playful fragment of music bleeding out of and into the songs before and after it on Solange’s albumWhen I Get Home.Because that album aspires to abstraction through repetitive loops and vocals, when you listen to the tracks sequentially, “Binz” feels like a respite. Its bassline is a lure, the hi-hat a metronome for your sacrum to ride. Multi-part harmonies and singsong back-and-forth between Solange and The-Dream feel like peering into a closed session. “Binz” is a banger, a sunny break from the self-serious mood ofWhen I Get Home. To call it an “interstitial” is to acknowledge its place in how we listen to music in this day and age. False starts while scanning a playlist, tinny snares from passing headphones, auto-play in all of your feeds: In 2019, sound is primarily experienced as fleeting.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_10,2019,bad guy,Simon Reynolds,"“bad guy” jumps out bynotjumping out. Its volume drops abruptly, pulling the listener in close, making them strain to catch the breath braided so exquisitely by Billie Eilish and her co-producer/brother, Finneas O’Connell. A pop miniaturist who shuns grand vocal acrobatics, she skirts the edge of inaudible to invent a new kind of subdued sass. Her virtuosity is in tone and texture: the delicious derision of “duh,” the way she smudges consonants and crumbles vowels in her mouth. Apart from the occasional deliberately unsubtle effect, like the juddering digital croak on the chorus, it’s an artfully crafted illusion of intimacy. “bad guy” is a crawlspace of a track that feels like it’s made of the same whispery fabric as Eilish’s voice: clicks, whirrs, fingersnaps, and ear-tickling sounds that prompt ASMR tingles. Furtive and nimble, the beat moves just like her lines about “creeping around like no one knows,” yet the bass, when it hits, has the dancefloor heft of trap. As for Eilish’s jaded goth-pop schtick? Those who can only remember being teenage may smile at lines like “My soul? So cynical.” But for the actual teens who’ve followed her rise to the top of the charts, Eilish captures the tender mess of being young and alive.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_9,2019,Not,Quinn Moreland,"With the release of the cosmicU.F.O.F.in May, Big Thief seemed content to spend 2019 suspended above Earth. They came crashing down with “Not.” The standout lead single fromTwo Hands, the quartet’ssecondincredible record of the year, is driven by carnal desperation. As a lyricist, Adrianne Lenker captures even the most abstract observations with profound precision. On “Not,” she uses that vivid specificity to outline an absence, her voice snarling and burning as she prowls around the indescribable. But like everything Big Thief does, the song’s stunning impact comes not from one bandmate, but from the collective whole; its force is the result of four intertwined spirits carving into themselves in hopes of digging up some sort of raw, corporeal clarity. When “Not” finally crescendos into a scorched-earth guitar solo, it feels more like an exorcism than an exhale.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_8,2019,Con Altura,Ben Cardew,"“Con Altura” roughly translates to “do it hard,” according to Rosalía, who borrowed the phrase froma Dominican TV personality. The song is aptly named, with the Catalan singer and Colombian star J Balvin exchanging swaggering verses that name-drop the Porsche Panamera and the flamenco icon Camarón de la Isla over a watertight reggaeton beat. El Guincho, who co-produced this and much of Rosalía’s breakthrough albumEl Mal Querer, also adds a brief vocal, his contribution a reminder of his days as a solo star in the Iberian underground. “Con Altura” invites the listener to admire the wonderful flex of Latin pop in the late 2010s: the way Rosalía’s flamenco inflection leans into the Caribbean pulse, how J Balvin takes on a larger-than-life, hip-hop bluster. It’s a perfect pop song of thrilling energy and dexterity. The song’s chorus alone is so rhythmically irresistible, it makes you wonder why Spanish wasn’talwayspop’s lingua franca.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_7,2019,Dawn Chorus,Jazz Monroe,"After the death of Rachel Owen—his former partner and the mother of his children—Thom Yorke, like many before, sought relief in Thom Yorke songs. He speaks of his return to creativity, and the way music airlifts the grief-stricken from despondency, in near-mystical terms. “If it’s needed,” hetoldthe New York Times, “it will find you.” Perhaps it’s telling that, on the solo albumANIMA, Yorke appears to confront his loss on a song called “Dawn Chorus.” It’s a title (if not the same composition) that fluttered around Radiohead lore for years. Famous to fans for its incompletion, it may, to Yorke, have symbolized refuge and endurance. On its glassy surface, the mournful lyrics are typically inscrutable. But the tone is one of illumination—a sense, rare in Yorke’s music, that the light at the end of the tunnel was daybreak, after all, and not just another false dawn. Its title, which refers to the birdsong that accompanies sunrise, could represent resolution, or perhaps the bittersweet end of a glorious night. Maybe it’s just a “bloody racket,” as Yorke mutters, riffing on how one man’s symphony is another’s dirge. The prettiest songs, he reminds us, will always be both at once.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_6,2019,Seventeen,Jeremy D. Larson,"After decades of owningthe age of 17, Stevie Nicks finally passed the torch. Let Sharon Van Etten be the new author of your 17th year: She knows its allure and innocence, how it feels to be on the cusp of adulthood. She knows the paradox of being a teen is that it’s all over soon, but it will stay with you forever. “Seventeen,” her anthem fromRemind Me Tomorrow,is the climax of her journey from quiet café folk singer to venerable rock star. It rolls like a boulder down a mile-long hill, pushed by a synth-rock snare and a seething, roaming performance from Van Etten as she feels every single word. When she performs the song live, she strafes around the stage, microphone in hand, like she’s searching the crowd for someone, until she finally finds her younger self among them and delivers the coup de grâce: “Afraid that you’ll be just like me.” How she invokes time, self, youth, guilt, and forgiveness with just one line reveals the masterful craft of Van Etten on one of her greatest songs yet.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_5,2019,Caro,Ryan Dombal,"When the concept of self-love has been commodified by hucksters selling$500 infrared sauna blankets, it can be tempting to toss all of your belongings into a dumpster and welcome a life of self-loathing instead. Luckily, with “Caro,” urbano shapeshifter Bad Bunny offers a more practical solution to embracing your worth. The song rescues ideas of empowerment from sponsored hashtag hell, with the Puerto Rican star flicking off critics of his androgynous style and class-collapsing brashness over a trap beat that’s as quietly menacing as an alien hovercraft. “Don’t you see that I’m expensive?” he spits in Spanish, voicing the indignance of anyone who’s been made to feel undeserving because of what they wear or who they love. Then, midway, the sinister instrumental evaporates, and Bad Bunny is joined by none other than Ricky Martin—who was once lambasted by Puerto Rican clergy members after he came out as gay—for a cloud-parting bridge that exposes the song’s pristine core: “Why can’t I just be?” they plead. “What harm is it to you? I’m just happy.” It’s a startlingly vulnerable moment, one that makes this anthem of acceptance that much more invincible.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_4,2019,Gone,Eric Torres,"A high-octane bridge between the rave-ups of Charli XCX’s past and the sleek robo-pop of her present, “Gone” is the best Charli of both worlds. The song’s central tension is nothing new—being surrounded by people yet feeling so alone—but how she chooses to alleviate that pain is something special: with a bombastic, bulletproof synth-pop chorus that revels in the roiling chaos of social anxiety. Christine and the Queens’ Héloïse Letissier is Charli’s perfect foil, adding her own cryptic ruminations on self-isolation over spiky synth stabs and glittering, glitched-out effects. Thetitillating videofor “Gone,” with Charli and Chris chained to and then dancing atop a white sports car in the rain, only solidified the song’s place as one of the most cathartic moments in pop this year.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_3,2019,Bags,Sasha Geffen,"The relationships in Clairo’s songs always teeter on the edge of chaos. On “Bags,” the lead single from her debut album,Immunity, the Gen Z pop songwriter sings with the kind of bittersweetness that could either herald the beginning of a new romance or signal its smoldering end. The image she paints repeatedly in the chorus—“walking out the door with your bags”—hangs frozen like a still from a movie, melancholic and unabating. Behind her, though, a synthesizer chirps like a second, excitable singer. It’s as if Clairo is envisioning a breakup at the very moment of the first kiss, the sparks and the sadness translucent and overlaid on top of each other. How do you savor intimacy when you can foresee its failure in vivid detail? “Bags” outlines the fight to stay present in the good stuff, even when your brain is fast-forwarding to the collapse.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_2,2019,The Greatest,Stephen Kearse,"On “The Greatest,” the big one—the ultimate disaster—looms large. Civilization teeters toward oblivion, the temperature climbs upward, and Lana Del Rey is our soothsayer. She narrates these end times with a wry resignation that’s nostalgic and tactile, dreamy yet prickly. Pining for Long Beach and a lost lover, missing the music and nightlife of New York, her response to the future is to cling to her past. She’s had a ball, but as she flips through the photo album, she concedes that the culture is a little too lit, that the heat is making her breath feel heavy. The gut punch of the song is that despite her exhaustion, she sounds fulfilled. There's contentment in her voice as it floats over Jack Antonoff's sour guitar chords and soft keys, as if she’s savoring her just desserts. This isn’t just a character study, though: As one woman's world goes up in smoke, Del Rey zooms out to observe other anguishes: Kanye West is a shadow of himself; Hawaii is panicked by fictional missile strikes; David Bowie’s vision of life on Mars is now being pursued by Elon Musk. As her voice drops to a whisper, she takes in this surreal and depressing panorama—what a truly ludicrous ending, right?—then suddenly she perks up. Why? Because there’s a livestream to watch. The greatest loss of all, it turns out, is our attention spans.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2019_1,2019,cellophane,Puja Patel,"It’s nearly impossible to separate the physicality of FKA twigs’ work from her voice—she moves with the trained precision of an athlete, changes costumes as if she’s shedding skin, and carries herself with the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean thespian. Projecting strength in moments of extreme fragility feels like it’s become part of her routine more recently; a very public breakup with her Hollywood ex was followed by the discovery of a medical condition anchored in her uterus. This year’sMAGDALENEwas twigs’ exorcism of those woes—the ones that suddenly appear on your doorstep, the ones brewing internally—with “cellophane” as its final absolution. Heartbreak is a trial so delicate that the slightest degree of pressure can shift whether it ends in acceptance or despair. On “cellophane,” twigs recognizes that fissure and puts on an acrobatic display of deciding whether she’ll dip a toe into the darkness of its void. It’s a song best listened to alone, where the beauty of its restraint can be made clear. A whisper of a beat propels an inquisition into self-doubt, longing, and regret—her voice aches, soaring with resolve before a gravitational pull brings it back down. A dreamy piano melody serves as a sidekick alongside synths that swell to a climax and then drop out altogether. It masterfully makes the ugly, complicated mess of interrogating lost love feel like an act of pride. Because when you’ve aimed a spotlight at yourself, perhaps all that matters is knowing you’re worthy of its glow.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2019,Pitchfork
2020_100,2020,dominique,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"After years of playing in emo bands and releasing candy-coated electropop, Ela Minus splits the difference on “dominique.” The standout from her debut LP, acts of rebellion, is a depressive ode to sleeping all day and never leaving the house set to bright, buoyant melodies. Even as she teeters on the edge of the abyss, wasting away with coffee and liquor as her only companions, she finds humor in the downward spiral: “I should probably eat something that’s not liquid,” she deadpans. Recorded more than a year before much of humanity was sheltering in place, its themes of isolation and delirium feel prescient, offering a view from indoors that, for many, will look like a reflection.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_99,2020,I Walk Alone With Acid,Linnie Greene,"The jarring dissonance between a four-on-the-floor acid-house beat and the burden of having a body makes electronic duo Pale Blue’s “I Walk Alone With Acid” more incisive than your average dance banger. “Is my body mine?/Is my fear real?” Elizabeth Wight asks breathily over Mike Simonetti’s propulsive beats, checking her glass before she sips, remembering that her keys can be a weapon in the dark. It’s a song for girls, gays, and theys leaving the club with a can of pepper spray and a prayer: an ominous reminder of the dangers of the walk home, a sonic shot of cortisol.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_98,2020,Dobby,Jamieson Cox,"There’s power in the intimacy of this song, in the scrape of the acoustic guitar’s strings and the finger snaps that guide its rhythm. Listening to “Dobby,” it feels like you’re right there in the room where singer-songwriter Benjamin Lyman is expressing his gratitude for the woman he loves in pure, unflinching language. The song is primarily a showcase for Lyman’s voice, and he fills its empty space with thrilling, wordless runs and tremulous melodies. He circles around the adoring chorus, using it as both a placeholder and a mantra: “She really loved me and she really gave it to me…” The air around him crackles with the joy of creation. When the song ends and the spell breaks, you can’t help but see your own loved ones with his wide-eyed wonder.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_97,2020,Horrible Person,Emma Madden,"Sometimes, trying to find a path forward after someone’s depleted you can feel like building a house of cards with a wet deck. On “Horrible Person,” the standout track from Brooklyn experimental musician Caitlin Pasko’s Greenhouse, you can hear the tension of someone painstakingly putting their life back together. “You… know… you… are… a... horrible... person,” she sings, as though she’s deliberately placing another soggy card down. Synths briefly wail alongside her, suggesting an undercurrent of rage. “Please stop texting me on... my... birthday,” she calmly requests, offering a glimpse into this person’s specific but universal kind of horrible. The song ends with a crunching loop of distortion, sonic rubble from which to once again become whole.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_96,2020,Acid,Jazz Monroe,"Jockstrap spent their conservatory studies molding pop and its pleasantries like haunted Silly Putty. With “Acid,” their debut single for Warp, the London duo angle their funhouse mirror at the sort of contemporary chanson-pop that soundtracks indie rom-coms and Francophile café culture. Beneath the lackadaisical surface, however, is a distinct lack of joie de vivre. Queasy electronics and sighs of “gas and blood and blood and blood” creep in on the subconscious level, disturbing the peace like dead pixels in lush cinematography. Whether portraying a complicated love or something more sinister, it’s an arresting vision of trouble in paradise.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_95,2020,Hula,Andy Cush,"The slow-motion electronic pop of Bullion’s “Hula” soundtracks a series of vacations, recounted as pleasantly fogged memories. The music is seductive, almost narcotic, with synth pads exhaling in long, overlapping layers. But something feels off. The instrumental break following an unexpected chord change lurches like a luxury liner in choppy water; melodic lines become queasily detuned. The London-based producer-songwriter is taciturn as a lyricist and a singer, but such off-center musical moments help to fill in the blanks, suggesting that holidays and hula dancing offered only partial reprieve from some looming anxiety. “Are people in pain where you are?” he wonders repeatedly, then thinks better of it: “I’ll ask you tomorrow.”",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_94,2020,Caution,Ian Cohen,"Like most of the Killers’ best songs, no one knows what “Caution” really means, but it gets the people going. Trying to make literal sense of why Brandon Flowers spends every verse sketching out a hard-luck heartbreaker with “Hollywood eyes” only to belt out on the chorus that he’s throwing caution to the wind is as futile as locating “South Detroit” on a map. Despite the blatant A Deeper Understanding fanfic, the Killers aren’t trying to copy the War on Drugs on “Caution” so much as paying the same kind of homage to them as Journey once did to Bruce Springsteen. Because there’s a time to lend quiet dignity to all the “black top white trash” and “featherweight queens,” and a time when they just want to burn brighter than the Las Vegas skyline.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_93,2020,Rockstar,Jayson Greene,"In 2019, Charlotte rapper DaBaby bull-charged rap with 100 frenetic variations on a single song, like a jabbering, grinning, dumb-punchline-dispensing perpetual motion machine. His yearlong blitzkrieg campaign garnered him a No. 1 album, a billion streams on Spotify, and a persistent reputation as a one-note artist. There are entire memes devoted to this idea; DaBaby spoofed it himself in the video for his Lil Yachty and Drake collaboration “Oprah’s Bank Account.” In 2020, DaBaby showed that he wasn’t just unstoppable; he was flexible. Yes, when he opens his mouth it still feels like being trampled by clowns. But on his hit “Rockstar,” he also showed that his brand of bottled energy could pop off with pretty much any soundtrack, including the kind of winsome faux-flamenco guitar over which Young Thug might explore his soulful side.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_92,2020,Hannah Sun,Will Miller,"Lomelda’s Hannah Read reckons with physical and emotional distance on “Hannah Sun.” She begins with a transatlantic separation, then zooms in progressively, first to a hometown phone call, then a close embrace. The music builds excitedly behind her, with flashes of synth joining the jittery acoustic guitar pulse. “Glad you held me, too/Though I didn’t know how to be closer to you,” Read admits at the climax, holding the last word for 20 aching seconds, an entire lungful of “you.” In an era of isolation, the song is a reminder of the simple warmth of being near.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_91,2020,WAKING UP DOWN,Sheldon Pearce,"In the flattened cycle of life in pandemic times, even the most mundane things can feel like arduous tasks. Yaeji released her glassy-eyed marvel “WAKING UP DOWN” just before the new normal set in, and it epitomizes the art of surviving an anxious existence by simply conquering the everyday. Over a tick-tock electro beat, the bleary synth production grows in intensity as hard-panned stereo effects become more disorienting. In English, she intones a little mantra about how well she’s coping—waking up, hydrating, cooking, and listening are among her accomplishments—as if warding off insecurity. Then, in Korean, she coos an important caveat: having it together is a war of attrition.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_90,2020,Echos,Simon Reynolds,"Argentine composer Beatriz Ferreyra is renowned for the disorienting spatiality and shape-shifting abstraction of her electronic and tape-based work, but it’s the human scale and raw intimacy of “Echos” that startle. Recorded in 1978 but released for the first time this year, the piece is woven entirely from the voice of Ferreyra’s niece Mercedes Cornu, who died in a car accident prior to its composition. In places, the young woman’s voice flickers and trembles with playful delight, sounding impossibly alive. At other points, the melted murmurs and shimmered syllables feel soothing and psalm-like, as though the girl’s ghost is mourning herself. Listening to “Echos” is as poignant as stumbling upon a roadside shrine of flowers, candles, and photos, but Ferreyra goes beyond creating a memorial to Mercedes: She defies death itself and resurrects her niece as an aural apparition. Heard at any time in the four decades since its making, “Echos” would be touching. But in a year like this one, it breaks your heart.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_89,2020,Care,Stuart Berman,"Beatrice Laus, aka beabadoobee, initially gained attention as a bedroom indie artist who dreams of Pavement and scored her first major success earlier this year playing the Dido to Canadian rapper Powfu’s Eminem on his sad-sack TikTok smash “death bed (coffee for your head).” But with “Care,” the lead single from her debut album Fake It Flowers, Laus makes a bid for stardom on her own terms. Striking the sweet spot between the folky yearning of Lisa Loeb and the bubble-grunge of Veruca Salt, “Care” is a readymade ’90s alt-rock anthem that sounds right at home in 2020—because, let’s face it: reality still bites.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_88,2020,Hate the Club,Claire Lobenfeld,"Kehlani turns temperamental nerves about her love life into measured cool on “Hate the Club.” The singer coos capriciously throughout: She stubbornly sits in the VIP alone to avoid her paramour before conjuring the courage to make amends. “Maybe if I drank enough/I’ll make my way over to ya,” she thinks out loud. The tension is eased by a slinky sax from future-soul artist Masego and then heightened by a polyphony of backup vocals that engulf the chorus with internal turmoil. The song climaxes with a confrontation, as the DJ shouts her out, blowing up her spot—“I still need you,” Kehlani pleads—though by the end it’s still unclear whether her dreaded trip out was worth the trouble.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_87,2020,ADMSDP,Gabriel Szatan,"Halfway through the gentle ebb of his album Mas Amable, DJ Python turns down a slipstream of inner consciousness. Poet LA Warman’s wary monologue sways over a faint backbeat suffused with the kind of dread usually found in haunted dubplates. Coming from Python, an ostensibly jolly club producer, “ADMSDP” might leave you grasping for your bearings. But then, what is a chill-out room if not a sensory deprivation tank with beanbags? The soft power of this 11-minute guided dissociation holds true of any therapeutic method: The more you give in to it, the more necessary it becomes.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_86,2020,Breathe Deeper,Noah Yoo,"What makes Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker so compelling is how he melds the sounds of his favorite pop idols with a production style that updates arena rock for the age of microdosing. On “Breathe Deeper,” you can hear Mariah Carey in the syrupy verse, the Neptunes in every raw drum hit, early Daft Punk in the finale’s acid house groove, and yet there’s no mistaking this for anything but a Tame Impala song. Parker said it was inspired by his first experience with MDMA, which accounts for the rave outro and the blissful piano hooks that make it the danciest cut on this year’s The Slow Rush. But he also sneaks in the briefest of guitar interludes, once again relying on incidental audio spliced in from our real world—the flip of a tape deck switch, the click and hiss of a needle on a vinyl record—to better bring us into his own.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_85,2020,Don Dada,Mina Tavakoli,"The best part of the video for “Don Dada”—a cocky, bouncy, sexy slice of hip-house courtesy of New York rapper Cakes Da Killa and producer Proper Villains—is when Cakes, in an ice-white tennis skirt, steals the focus from a leonine model by shaking his ass in triple-time. He’s always been less concerned with genre confines than with rapping over anything that ensures that he’s the main character, and this Paris Is Burning credits-worthy, vogue-ready burner feels like a final, ascendant role by several orders of magnitude. Hearing a track this haute and juicy in 2020 is borderline rude for how much it makes us miss the rush of nightlife, but Cakes has never really been polite about his spotlight.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_84,2020,IPHONE,Jessica Kariisa,"The first single off of Rico Nasty’s raucous album Nightmare Vacation considers the peaks and valleys of romantic love as analogous to our unhealthy relationships with our phones. Peppered with references to early aughts technological obsessions (“He on my hip like a Tamagotchi/Leave a heart on my wall so I can know you like me”), the track offers nostalgia wrapped up in the saccharine chimes and futurist hyperpop of 100 gecs mastermind Dylan Brady’s production. In the track’s most tender moments, the maxed-out vocal effects are toned down to center Rico’s melodic pleas for affection, capturing the unique angst of chasing love behind a screen.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_83,2020,Suite pour l’invisible,Emma Madden,"Ana Roxanne makes even silence sound vivid. A former student of Mills College’s acclaimed experimental-music program and current member of the Kranky Records roster, which includes the likes of Grouper and Tim Hecker, Roxanne draws inspiration from classical Hindustani singing and sacred choral music in her ambient soundscapes. “Suite pour l’invisible,” from Roxanne’s second album, Because of a Flower, maps self-knowledge onto a soothing drone and keys that twinkle like bokeh. “I hold your joy/I hold your pain,” she sings over heavenly synth tones. It’s the sound of the self turned into an atmosphere.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_82,2020,Furies,Eric Torres,"Restless experimentalist Moor Mother couples her searing spoken-word delivery with New York rapper billy woods’ oblique rhymes to mesmerizing effect on this one-off collaborative single. The duo’s rapport is even-footed and intimate over flutes and knocking hand drums. Where Moor Mother speaks to battling inner and outer demons, her intoning voice echoing and relentless, woods is an ideal foil, adding drifting verses that lead to a needling concern: “What did I want?” The artful “Furies” leads listeners along its own orbit, with no easy answers to its cryptic questions.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_81,2020,River Dreams,Jemima Skala,"On the deeply spiritual “River Dreams,” a new song included on Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s career-spanning 2020 compilation Transmissions, the pioneering experimental musician sings rich and soft invocations that encourage reflection, accompanied by circular piano melodies and synthetic orchestral chords. The meditative track speaks to finding fulfillment out of what little you have around you, learning to tune into the universe when it speaks, and grounding yourself in small moments of serenity—necessary reminders amid a year of unprecedented turmoil.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_80,2020,Hit Different,Ashley Bardhan,"SZA has an unparalleled ability to draw out the most intoxicating parts of an unhealthy relationship and turn them into an intoxicating song. “Hit Different” is misted with heady sluggishness, dragging drums, and Ty Dolla $ign’s honeyed voice, soft with the truth of a late-night realization. But SZA is buoyant as she sings about her inconsistent love. He’ll never prioritize her, but she presents her conflicting shame and pleasure openly. Getting carried away by languid harmonies and the open wound of SZA’s honesty, you start to wonder if there’s anything you’re hiding from yourself.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_79,2020,Sayonara,Philip Sherburne,"Outwardly, Kate NV’s “Sayonara” is an ebullient hybrid of Japanese city pop and early-’80s avant disco; each element is daubed on in bold splotches of color, and its empty space suggests voluminous proportions. But there’s also something lonely and maybe even a little spooky about the song, which the Moscow musician says was written during a difficult time. In a high, breathy voice wreathed in delay, she sings short, repeated phrases mostly in Russian: “Yes, yes, yes/No, no, no/Sayonara, goodbye.” Affirmation, negation, disappearance. Entering the world of this song is like walking into an opulent room where a party has just concluded, as the host’s farewell fades down the hallway.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_78,2020,Backflip or Sumn,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Drakeo the Ruler has long been unfazeable, but on his latest LP, Thank You for Using GTL, recorded on a payphone from the Men’s Central Jail in Los Angeles County, ice water flows through his veins. Staring down trumped-up conspiracy charges in which his music was on trial as much as his actions, Drakeo oozes with swagger over a moody JoogSzn beat on “Backflip or Sumn.” He casually drops threats and flexes on the case he eventually did manage to beat, all the while stressing how unimpressed he is by it all. That he would cut a record full of the same kind of lyrics being used against him in a sham court proceeding is more than just chutzpah. It’s evidence that he remains unfazed—by the county sheriff, by the prosecutor, and by that giant bag of money at the strip club.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_77,2020,Sunblind,Quinn Moreland,"On “Sunblind,” Fleet Foxes frontman Robin Pecknold proudly partakes in the age-old tradition of memorializing one’s heroes in song. He invokes late greats like Richard Swift, Judee Sill, and Elliott Smith, wrapping their works around him like a security blanket. “I’m gonna swim for a week in warm American Water with dear friends,” he proclaims, playfully nodding to Silver Jews’ David Berman, who passed away last year after decades of tortured brilliance. Even though “Sunblind” is an ode to the departed, it never succumbs to melancholy. Instead, it serves as a celebration of music as a source of solace and rejuvenation, and an exhilarating reminder of its profound potential.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_76,2020,Tap In,Mankaprr Conteh,"Saweetie builds contemporary hits out of ’00s hip-hop anthems, consistently inverting their masculine attitudes to make them her own. “Tap In” twists West Coast legend Too $hort’s “Blow the Whistle” into a mnemonic device for bagging a man with big money, and her tone is matter-of-fact, like she’s the smartest student of the game in your study group. After the California rapper caught flack for her overt materialism this year, she clarified that she demands riches of men more symbolically than literally. So even if you’ll never meet a dude earning eight figures, “Tap In” is an energizing lesson in assessing your worth and asserting your standards.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_75,2020,Long Road Home,Leah Mandel,"Experiencing Oneohtrix Point Never’s “Long Road Home,” with its soft-rock swirl enveloping Caroline Polachek’s mystical vocals, is like immersing yourself in a supernatural coming-of-age road-trip movie. It feels like looking up at the stars on the way back home when you’re 16 and missing your friends; Peter Gabriel is on the radio and the new issue of Heavy Metal awaits you in your bedroom. (Judging from the sound of the production, it’s 1983 via 2083.) A torch song from Mars, “Long Road Home” is OPN with his romance meter at full gauge: romance of the very far away, romance of a car at night with a long way to go, romance of reuniting after isolation.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_74,2020,I Fell in Love,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"While Helado Negro’s Roberto Carlos Lange has been exploring experimental sounds and textures for more than a decade, his more recent work adopts more pleasant frequencies in service of space-age lullabies and healing spells. “I Fell in Love,” a one-off single featuring the eclectic Brooklyn singer-songwriter Xenia Rubinos, is likely the most direct song either artist has ever made. Yet there’s power in this simplicity—it eliminates any obstacles that might stand in the way of the song’s sentiment, becoming an aural manifestation of love itself. Lange’s soothing voice turns hypnotic when drenched in reverb, and Rubinos returns the energy in kind, beaming lights into the dark.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_73,2020,Angel,Matthew Strauss,"Standing on the Corner have a way of capturing the wooziness of love. In its tenderest moments, the experimental jazz-indebted ensemble slows things down in order to disorient and emotionally disarm—the sonic equivalent of watching the world melt as your darling walks away upside-down and backward on the ceiling. “Angel” is another lovesick moment, resembling the group’s doleful rendition of the jazz standard “Body and Soul.” The melody is sumptuous, somewhere between carnal and spiritual, with bursts of distortion or horns punctuating the wobbling beat. “Angel” is sad but happy, alluring yet absurd, expressing the simple things we struggle to define.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_72,2020,Lockdown,Jenzia Burgos,"Koffee’s summertime anthem opens with a question that most people have probably asked themselves at some point in 2020: Where will we go after this whole “quarantine ting” is over? On “Lockdown,” reggae’s youngest Grammy winner sings of spirited plans to drive around and travel, but she also reveals there’s something else—someone, actually—to this dream of an island adventure. “Me ah go put you pon lockdown,” Koffee insists, the clever wordplay spelling out a shamelessly jubilant love story in the age of ’rona.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_71,2020,mirrorball,Sam Sodomsky,"On a different Taylor Swift album, “mirrorball” might have been the shining pop centerpiece. The songwriting is airborne and graceful, using lyrics about hushed conversations, burning discos, and “shimmering beautiful” visions as melodic cues. But instead of aiming for the sugar rush of Swift’s early work or the arena grandeur of 1989, it stands as one of folklore’s subtlest moments. The atmosphere is intimate and understated, as if we’re hearing her thoughts before she has time to process them. “I’ve never been a natural,” she sings over dreamy electric guitars and a lapping drumbeat that sounds buried under several layers of comforters. She seems lost in the moment, like she has no one to please but herself.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_70,2020,Scottie Beam,Dean Van Nguyen,"Alchemist’s flickering piano keys are ideal for spilling loose ruminations. Freddie Gibbs floods the screen with drama—a police traffic stop that risks turning violent; warning cops about his personal arsenal—but when he repeats, “The revolution is the genocide/Look, your execution will be televised,” it feels like the perfect flip of Gil Scott-Heron’s message for an era when footage of Black death floods the news. Then Rick Ross rides in to drop his best guest spot since “Devil in a New Dress” and the message of “Scottie Beam” from the two veteran rappers couldn’t be clearer: they’re still getting better.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_69,2020,The Box,Jonah Bromwich,"There’s something infinitely charming about the first 15 seconds of Roddy Rich’s chart-topper “The Box,” before the song’s hi-hats, reverse 808s, and run of inescapable melodies even get going. At the beginning, it’s just Roddy, screeching “eeech urh” into the mic, like a toddler exploring vowel sounds for the first time. It’s ludicrous. But it works, locking listeners into one of the most curiously infectious hits of the year.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_68,2020,Bittersweet,Natalie Weiner,"British singer-songwriter Lianne La Havas would be forgiven for simply coasting on her rich voice and its impossibly slow vibrato. Instead, she’s spent three albums piecing together her own painfully intimate take on neo-soul. “Bittersweet,” the opener of her eponymous third LP, envelopes La Havas’ heart-wrenching ache with production that’s as warm and inviting as a crackling bonfire. The pathos of its most powerful lyric—“No more hangin’ around”—is fitting for the way our most intense feelings are sometimes shrouded in casual language; the things that sound trivial when we say them are made concrete by La Havas’ startling performance.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_67,2020,Mequetrefe,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Arca’s music has always challenged listeners to free themselves from the constructs of pop, embrace bedlam, and find melodies in the noise. While her earlier releases were sometimes marked by nearly impenetrable abstractions, KiCK i feels just accessible enough to draw listeners into its maelstrom of chaos. Few tracks exemplify this duality as well as “Mequetrefe,” an ode to self-expression sans shame. Losing none of the aggression and confrontation that make her records so arresting, “Mequetrefe” is buoyed by a sweet and tender string melody that’s at odds with its twitchy surroundings but at peace with itself.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_66,2020,Whole New Mess,Eric Torres,"The title track to Angel Olsen’s stripped-back 2020 album is one of her most haunting songs in a catalog full of them. Thick with reverb, Olsen’s flinty vibrato sounds worn-down and raw, as the fraught strums behind her recall the spartan folk music of her early records. Her spare sound palette is in service of an insatiate self-analysis on fame, addiction, and feeling unrooted in life. Olsen’s elegiac melody gives weight to her words, offering a troubled tribute to maintaining your sanity when everything else seems to be falling apart.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_65,2020,JU$T,Jeremy Gordon,"Like any superhero team-up or buddy comedy, the formula for an RTJ song is carved in stone by now: Killer Mike the swaggering priest and El-P sardonic philosopher, threatening R-rated violence and revolutionary action over sounds rescued from hip-hop’s golden era and retrofitted for pre-pandemic festival stages. As with all must-see serialized dramas, the guest stars are just as impressive as the main cast. Enter Pharrell, reciting a mantra about the circular clutches of modern capitalism in the laconic tone he once used to brag about his Gandalf hat; enter Zack de la Rocha, erstwhile Rage Against the Machine frontman, incendiary and conspiratorial about wanting to rip those systems apart. El-P’s production reins in his usual glitchy energy of a in favor of near-military restraint as he memorializes Eric Garner, and Killer Mike casually advocates for the murder of our corporate overlords. Take direction at your own risk, but nobody can doubt their commitment.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_64,2020,Lick in Heaven,Noah Yoo,"Rage can be a powerful force for good when focused, but taming it is often difficult. This tricky dance between intensity and chaos plays out on Jessy Lanza’s “Lick in Heaven”: The bounce of the bass synth and Lanza’s angelic voice are red herrings for the song’s angry underpinnings. On one level, the song is about letting loose with the feelings you keep pent up inside. On another, it’s about catching yourself in the throes of your worst moments, taking a step back, and reclaiming control of your life.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_63,2020,"I Love (Mimi, Moms, Kev)",Philip Sherburne,"Ka’s Descendants of Cain paints a bleak picture of the Brownsville rapper’s hood, where street justice and biblical judgement go hand in hand. The album’s first 10 songs are a litany of bullets, scars, and endless striving, but the mood shifts with the closing “I Love (Mimi, Moms, Kev),” a tribute to his wife, mother, and late friend. In contrast to the album’s eerily stark beats, “I Love” blossoms unexpectedly. “Now death is minor, ’cause you got me livin’ life major,” he tells his wife, the key change mirroring his outlook. He marvels that his mother “showed me love when all I seen was hate.” His typically labyrinthine verses straighten out, as though the page itself had become unburdened. Capping an album that lingers hauntingly on his past, “I Love” is a tribute to the very streets that shaped him: “Everybody called it the slums, but we know it as home.”",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_62,2020,The Mackenzies,Andy Cush,"“The Mackenzies” begins inauspiciously, with a broken-down car and some unsolicited advice from a neighbor. From there, the turns it takes are so quietly strange, and strangely moving, that any further discussion of its lyrics might require a spoiler alert. Against a spare acoustic guitar backdrop, in his own increasingly fatherly baritone, Bill Callahan tells a faintly supernatural story of parents and children, life and death, and the profound closeness and distance that can coexist between people. The song’s final scene—forgive the spoiler—is indelible: A man drifts off to sleep while two elder strangers stand in the doorway. “It’s okay, son,” they tell him. “We’re okay.”",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_61,2020,The Neverending Story,Paul A. Thompson,"A decade ago, the New Orleans native Jay Electronica enchanted with a series of cryptic dispatches, then vanished in a cloud of smoke and British tabloids. This year saw the release of not only his long-lost debut—precipitated by a targeted leak—but also a replacement record, a restart of sorts, which paired him with Jay-Z. The latter, A Written Testimony, often grapples with the pressure that drove Electronica from the spotlight. But on “The Neverending Story,” he raps over Alchemist’s pensive Litto Nebbia loop about the wonder he still sees in the world—a motorcycle ride to the desert, the gold teeth that make his smile shine like a Frankie Beverly song.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_60,2020,Gaslighter,Allison Hussey,"The Chicks dropped “Gaslighter”—the title track of their first album in 14 years—on March 4, shortly before 2020 went all the way up in flames. Its belt-along chorus and Natalie Maines’ post-divorce barbs make the song immediately satisfying, a dose of the band’s familiar blistering humor served with an assurance that they were ready for the current moment after so much time away. Maines’ admissions of vulnerability only further root her battle cries in her humanity, speaking to a righteous channel of rage, sorrow, and bewilderment at the hurt of a relationship gone to hell. The salve of “Gaslighter” is easy to apply to almost any wound, whether or not it involves a now-ex-husband misbehaving on a boat.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_59,2020,forever,Calum Marsh,"Written and recorded in self-isolation at home in Los Angeles—under the pressure of a self-imposed May deadline—Charli XCX’s how i’m feeling now already feels like a relic of another time. The album’s lead single, the soaring, heartfelt “forever,” captured the early-quarantine mood perfectly: vulnerable and sincere, the song finds Charli bearing her emotions with stunning clarity and candor. “I’ll love you forever,” she swears, over a rush of radiant synths, “even when we’re not together.” It’s a moving testament to a romance that right now means everything—even if it ultimately fades away.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_58,2020,Yo Perreo Sola,Stefanie Fernández,"Perreo, as a genre, dance, and movement, has always been about power. And with “Yo Perreo Sola,” Bad Bunny offers a consent-driven treatise centering a woman’s independence on the dancefloor. The video even features the superstar donning the chains, latex, and thigh-high boots of the song’s narrator, as he exhibits a genuine desire to play with gender expression in a genre often catered to the male gaze. But “Yo Perreo Sola” also repeated reggaetón’s long-standing pattern of relegating female vocalists to anonymity; Puerto Rican rapper Nesi, who delivers its chorus with a passionate drawl, was uncredited upon the song’s release. The oversight was later rectified with a remix featuring her (this time with a credit) alongside pioneer Ivy Queen—whose legendary “Quiero Bailar” set the terms for this track—providing vindication for the caballotas who just want to dance in peace.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_57,2020,Onyeka (Baby),Mina Tavakoli,"No man is a whole movement. But Burna Boy—who put out an album ambitiously titled African Giant last year, then doubled down on his promise with 2020’s Twice as Tall—has made his career by convincingly begging to differ. “Onyeka (Baby)” is an indestructibly sweet, sunny moment amid a colossal album of dancehall, Afrobeats, and pop, another of Burna’s Sisyphean efforts to compress the breadth of pan-Africanism into his person. Not since Fela Kuti has one artist blended the contradictions, agonies, and triumphs of the continent with so much muscle.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_56,2020,Pussy Talk,Allison P. Davis,"Yung Miami and JT of City Girls are grade-A, gold-standard shit talkers. It’s what makes their music so fun to listen to, and on “Pussy Talk” they’re at their best, enlisting Doja Cat in a rundown of all the things their pussies want, can or can’t do, will or won’t tolerate. When considered as part of a pussy-exalting trilogy, with Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP” and Meg’s “Don’t Stop” as the grand finale, “Pussy Talk” gets even better. In 2016, the 45th president all but ruined the word, but now with the end of his reign, pussy can spend the rest of the 2020s reclaiming its identity. According to City Girls, it is multitalented, multilingual (“English, Spanish, and French”), rich, demanding, and in complete control.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_55,2020,Sweet,Sophie Kemp,"“Sweet” is a character study of a woman on the edge of mania. Porridge Radio frontwoman Dana Margolin sings as if her insides are aflame, delivering lines with nearly feral bravado. As her narrator bites her fingernails and fends off a mother’s backhanded expressions of concern, the song oscillates between nervous, flayed post-punk and outbursts of metallic distortion. The music illustrates the Sisyphean task of feeling better: Each time it reaches some measure of calm, the noise comes roaring back.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_54,2020,Cue Synthesizer,Sam Sodomsky,"Like so many Destroyer songs before it, “Cue Synthesizer” is a grim view of a dilapidated world, led by a tour guide who can hardly stomach the sight. “Been to America, been to Europe,” Dan Bejar sings distractedly. “It’s all the same shit.” To accompany the voyage, he commands a small band in his head—“Bring in the drums/Cue fake drums,” he sighs—but the actual accompaniment refuses to follow his orders. It’s all ghostly ambience, groovy slap bass, and serpentine, canned electric guitar solos. The result feels slightly apocalyptic, weirdly funny, and right on time.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_53,2020,Free Joe Exotic,Alphonse Pierre,"There are few acceptable places to play “Free Joe Exotic” outside of your own headphones. On the jaw-dropping track, Flint, Michigan-raised Bfb Da Packman raps about how he would rather hurl himself from a bridge than wear a condom, twists the Sour Patch Kids slogan into a pun about oral sex, and accuses a girl of telling a tall tale about the size of his junk: “She said she can feel it in her stomach, stop capping/Ol’ lyin’ ass bitch, my dick ain’t that big.” And all that’s in just the first verse. Not even in Michigan, the current rap capital of darkly funny shit talking, will you find anyone thinking more unholy thoughts than Packman.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_52,2020,QADIR,Jessica Kariisa,"Nick Hakim’s tribute to a deceased childhood friend shines in the details. Steady yet anxious congas, a gentle flute, and bright keys meld into an affectingly soulful plea for a kinder world. Like passing through a space inhabited by the spirits of lost loved ones, “QADIR” is both comforting and unsettling. As the track swells to symphonic levels, Hakim’s dusty timbre staggers to a halt and gives way to a haunting 10-person chorus, surrendering to a feeling that can no longer be expressed by words. Much like a life, “QADIR” reverberates long after it ends.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_51,2020,I Know Alone,Dayna Evans,"“I Know Alone” may have been written before the pandemic, but its reflections on solitude hit especially hard in a year when pretty much everyone was forced to live life as a glorified hermit. The song is a groggy anthem for those days when counting the spots on your ceiling can feel like too much work. “Nights turn into days, that turn to gray, keep turning over,” Danielle Haim sings with quiet desperation. The moody bassline delivers a melody to curl up in and brood, while the uptempo beat towards the end is a reminder that even loneliness ends.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_50,2020,Melt!,Noah Yoo,"“Melt!” might tap into the space-age magic of early techno classics like Cybotron’s “Clear,” but instead of using ascending synth notes to reach toward the heavens, London producer Kelly Lee Owens focuses on anchoring you to Earth with sternum-cracking bass. The unrelenting drums are a perfect match for the field recordings of glacial melt that Owens sprinkles in for ambience and texture, her shuffling hi-hats pinging across the tundra. This is club music sequenced with computers and hardware, but “Melt!” is resolutely human at its core—a frenzied celebration of our planet that also warns of its impending demise.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_49,2020,Physical,Jackson Howard,"Dua Lipa’s “Physical” is pure adrenaline: a stand-up-the-second-you-hear-it masterpiece of power pop that can transform a dancefloor into something feral, or at least help you eke out one last push-up. Sweaty and cathartic, it’s the high-water mark of Lipa’s knockout second album, Future Nostalgia. “Physical” is just that, from the threatening, Eurythmics-adjacent synth line that anchors the beat, to Lipa’s soaring chorus, which pleads for human touch as much as it demands it. It’s the sound of a precocious pop star throwing off the restraints, cracking her knuckles, and stepping into the fray.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_48,2020,Dragonball Durag,Mano Sundaresan,"Thundercat has Dragon Ball Z tattoos all over his body. He also wrote “Dragonball Durag,” a strange and glorious ball of fuzz that, like his best songs, threatens to flutter away at any moment. On the track, the L.A. virtuoso best known for his imaginative bass lines and staggering fretwork embarks on a quixotic quest to woo a love interest with his speckled headwear. The goal is out of sight, the means absurd. But the groove is so serious that it’s all gospel.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_47,2020,The Ascension,Ryan Dombal,"After eulogizing his late mother on 2015’s startlingly bare Carrie & Lowell, Sufjan Stevens is now grappling with the death of his own ego. The songwriter sounds like he’s taking himself to task on the title track from his eighth studio album, suggesting the hushed hopelessness and conflicted faith that propel so much of his work add up to little more than a performative mess. But he doesn’t do away with those trademarks on “The Ascension”; he uses them as a mirror for even deeper self-investigation. As a muted instrumental flutters in the background, recalling a hollowed-out version of his anthem “Chicago,” a choir of Sufjans repeatedly asks, “What now?” Against the odds, a swell of synths finally hints at something like salvation.",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_46,2020,Guilty Conscience,Jenzia Burgos,"070 Shake’s hypnotic voice makes hard things go down easier. In 2018, it was her verse on Kanye West’s “Ghost Town” that saved ye from complete, disaffected gloom. Now, on her debut LP, the GOOD Music/Def Jam recruit pours a spacey sheen over her own battles with substance abuse, heartbreak, and suicidal ideation to self-soothe, rather than self-destruct. And she does it best on “Guilty Conscience,” a big, ambient pop record that tells of a lover’s remorse after catching their partner cheating, only to reveal that they cheated first. With the sound of her vocals soaring over gauzy ’80s synths, even guilt gets its moment of grace.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_45,2020,Ordinary Talk,Nina Corcoran,"Half Waif’s Nandi Rose loves the process of working through her problems, but she’s never captured the bittersweet realities of what that means like she does on “Ordinary Talk.” Atop solemn synths and pulsing bass drum, she establishes guidelines for facing personal struggles: cry openly, laugh at TV, fold laundry, and, above all else, be prepared to do it alone. It’s a cold truth made warm in Rose’s hands, thanks to revitalizing choral harmonies that mirror the magic of self-affirmation with each swell.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_44,2020,We Paid,Matthew Strauss,"With the touring industry stalled in 2020, it seemed like every rapper on Earth tried to make up for the loss with their very own digital deluxe reissue, padding out recent albums with extra tracks. For the most part, though, quality lacked. Only one artist made his album better with its deluxe edition: Lil Baby, who added a number of great songs to My Turn. None were greater than “We Paid,” his triumphant collaboration with protégé 42 Dugg. Baby plays the elder statesman on the quietly menacing track, rapping more ferociously than usual while letting Dugg take the lead. “We Paid” is smooth and confident: If you can’t hustle like you used to, Baby suggests, find new ways to flourish.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_43,2020,Murphy’s Law,Evan Minsker,"Róisín Murphy’s glossy totem to the dancefloor is based on an adage that feels extremely appropriate given this year’s circumstances: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. But consequences be damned, there’s no hesitation when Murphy’s smoky voice sings about getting back on her feet. She’s said that this song is the story of her life, and while she’s right that things go wrong no matter what, the lyrics also pose a reasonable question for the rest of us: what have you got to lose? Take chances, live life, and dance as much as possible.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_42,2020,WHOLE WORLD,Jayson Greene,"Earl Sweatshirt and Maxo have both made their homes in the rain-blurred realm where raps feel like unspoken thoughts, where beats resemble humming machinery a block away—a world of smudged loops, two or three notes long, punctured by diaristic jottings that flash like lightning. “Devil hittin’ my peripherals,” Maxo mutters on “WHOLE WORLD,” over a three-minute heart-murmuring loop from Alchemist. Earl’s own flow is hesitant, probing for meaning in the cracks between sound and sense: “Anxious, moving at a pallbearer’s pace/My family flank me in the rain.” The two of them are standing completely still, speaking in code, letting the wind take their thoughts to whoever might hear them.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_41,2020,Kawasaki Backflip,Evan Minsker,"Dogleg honed the wild catharsis of “Kawasaki Backflip” across dozens of shows in bars and small rooms before it opened Melee, the Michigan emo wrecking crew’s debut album. In another year, its layered guitar work and massive drums would have prompted massive pits and reckless stage dives at outdoor music festivals. Instead, self-isolation became an oddly fitting context for frontman Alex Stoitsiadis’ screams about solitude, destruction, and an uncertain future. Hopefully, for Dogleg, that future involves kids doing literal backflips into much bigger crowds.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_40,2020,Like That Bitch,Isabelia Herrera,"Flo Milli’s “Like That Bitch” is like a shot of bad bitch juice, a potent steroid for dealing with enemies, envy, and haters in general. Over three and a half breathless minutes, she shoots off rounds of snappy taunts and neck-breaking flexes; you can practically feel Flo Milli curling her lips and flipping her hair as she compares you to “a toilet with some lips.” The Alabama rapper serves up plates of deliciously petty barbs and flaunts four different flows, offering us a taste of her lifestyle of money-making and man-taking. All you can do is bask in the power of Flo Milli shit.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_39,2020,I Know the End,Mark Richardson,"“I Know the End” packs an album’s worth of ideas into five minutes and 45 seconds. One moment the Punisher closer is a hushed acoustic ballad, the next it’s a swelling mid-tempo strummer, and then it explodes into an orchestral fanfare, and each section has its own emotional arc. It’s something like Phoebe Bridgers’ version of Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush,” in which fear and bombed-out desolation are buoyed by an undercurrent of defiance. She has a rare ability to connect the fragmented images passing by the window to what she feels inside: She shows us funnel clouds dropping from the sky, a slaughterhouse, and a shopping mall, and turns each into a signpost for her own confusion. As the song builds, despair is tempered by a burst of energy that hints at survival. When it finally detonates and a seeming cast of thousands join in to shout “The end is here!” we come to understand her apocalypse as one frightening and cathartic in equal measure.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_38,2020,Bad Friend,Dani Blum,"Pop music loves to memorialize doomed romances and terrible exes; the genre offers considerably less for failed friendships. But on “Bad Friend,” Rina Sawayama gives friend breakups their own ballad. She confronts her guilt for fading out of a friend’s life, chronicling the memories of intimacy—sweaty karaoke singalongs, summer nights in the city—and the quiet corrosion of falling out of touch. A sense of shame courses through the track, undercutting her excuses (“Don’t ask me where I’ve been/Been avoiding everything,” she admits) until a choir of voices swells up to join her in communal confession: “Put your hands up if you’re not good at this stuff.” The relief doesn’t come easy, but once it does, the song softens and shines. Sawayama’s catharsis demands interrogation and forgiveness.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_37,2020,Vanishing Twin,Sam Sodomsky,"One of the year’s greatest, and most unusual, guitar solos arrives near the end of “Vanishing Twin,” when Blake Mills conjures a haunted rumble that echoes like a ghost that’s not quite ready to cross over. It serves as the grand finale to an especially intimate folk song, hinting at the virtuosic talent he often keeps behind the scenes. The California artist had a breakthrough year lending his touch to albums by Bob Dylan, Phoebe Bridgers, and Perfume Genius, but on his own record, Mutable Set, he explored an elegant quiet that’s entirely his own. He sings “Vanishing Twin” in a double-tracked whisper over a deceptively complex arrangement of fretless bass, plucked strings, and distant percussion. “Skin on skin,” he murmurs. “Soon you will know where I’ve been.” And then he reaches for the guitar and shows you where he’s going.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_36,2020,Mustang,Hannah Jocelyn,"With “Mustang,” Bartees Strange took everything he knew about indie rock and put it into one massive song. Set to walls of guitar and synth hooks, his lyrics contain a nod to the music that inspired him as a Black teenager interested in punk and indie, and to the unfulfilling jobs he worked for years to pay the bills before quitting to focus on performing and producing. Throughout “Mustang,” Strange offers intimate confessions like, “It's nice to think that folks are near/Waking up was hard this year,” but the song is unapologetically loud enough to get anyone out of bed.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_35,2020,The Steps,Mike Powell,"For those of us raised on the red meat of American classic rock, “The Steps” is the kind of song you know as soon as you hear it. Does the Haim sisters’ embrace of simple pleasures—the bubblegum guitar riff, the easy harmonies, the big chorus—signal a lack of imagination? Not any more than someone who manages to make jeans and a T-shirt look beautiful. “I can’t understand why you don’t understand me, baby,” Danielle complains. Maybe it’s because she’s more complicated than the song lets on. Just because it’s comfort food doesn’t mean it’s easy to cook.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_34,2020,Song 33,Rawiya Kameir,"At the apex of this summer’s racial-justice uprising, Noname released the J. Cole diss track “Song 33.” He had launched the first volley with “Snow on tha Bluff,” a grating whinge about being out-woked by a woman widely presumed to be Noname. She swats him away handily, the diss track equivalent of receiving a long text and dismissing it with a “K.” Its opening line, delivered in her characteristic hush, reflects decades of Black radical feminist critique: “I see a demon on my shoulder, it’s looking like patriarchy.” After coolly ethering Cole—over a cascading Madlib beat, no less—Noname busies herself with more important things: eulogizing murdered activist Toyin Salau, highlighting the crisis of violence against trans women, name-checking George Floyd, and calling for a break up of Amazon. And it only takes her a minute.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_33,2020,On My Own,Jesse Dorris,"One thing nine months more or less alone reveals is whom to miss and whom to let go. Always ahead of his time, Shamir wrote an anthem for figuring this out before lockdown; lucky for us, he released it just as the loneliness really set in. “On My Own” is bittersweet like prime Breeders, its sugary hooks enrobing drums as light and crunchy as puffed rice. His voice, dexterous as Prince’s, does the most in a full range of light and shade. But the simple precision of the song’s sentiment—“And I feel it in my bones/Inside myself is where I belong”—is what stands out the most. In a year defined by dancing on your own, Shamir made it sound like self-actualization.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_32,2020,the last great american dynasty,Anna Gaca,"Taylor Swift’s Rhode Island estate was already notorious—for those spectacular Fourth of July parties, for the Tom Hiddleston photos, for costing so much money ($17.75 million, in cash) that it inspired the governor to propose a new tax on second homes. But even Taylor Swift-sized drama doesn’t seem so juicy compared to “the last great american dynasty,” a highlight from her summer quarantine album folklore that traces the glamorous, troubled life of 20th-century heiress Rebekah Harkness, who married into Standard Oil money and—here comes the big reveal—lived in that very same enormous hilltop mansion. With the intrigue of a story song and the intimacy of a biography, Swift delves into socialite anthropology and returns with an epitaph for a woman she’ll never meet. The real magic is the winking humility of the image in the mirror: a woman criticized endlessly for being too rich and too gauche who knows that living well is still the best revenge.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_31,2020,Lilacs,Rawiya Kameir,"Katie Crutchfield christened her solo project Waxahatchee in honor of a creek in her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama; she now lives in Kansas City, a metropolis bifurcated by the country’s longest river. But the water she sings of on “Lilacs,” a stunning highlight from this spring’s Saint Cloud, comes in a bottle: Her flowers drink Topo Chico, a sparkling mineral water sourced from an inactive Mexican volcano with purported healing qualities. There’s a built-in reverb grounding Crutchfield’s falsetto, and it sounds like an unexpectedly early thaw, like the comforting promise that when flowers wilt and eventually die, it’s because they will soon bloom anew. So too will she. “I’ll fill myself back up like I used to do,” she trills, buoyant over a wide-open, folky guitar. Like a gentle river, time passing slowly is better than it not passing at all.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_30,2020,FANCY,Alphonse Pierre,"Amaarae’s delicate vocals melt into a beat like butter on a warm slice of bread. On “Fancy,” glistening drums and spare guitar strums set the stage, but the Ghanaian-American singer’s babyish delivery is the real draw. She uses her candy-sweet vocal melodies to boldly and justly praise her own glamour: “Every day I do my dance in the mirror ’cause I feel so damn fancy.” Then she goes on to repeat the word “fancy” a few more times, reiterating her bravado with the ease of a feather floating down from the sky and landing on your nose.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_29,2020,POP,Ryan Dombal,"Lil Uzi Vert just beamed down in a pair of Balenciaga jeans that cost more than your biweekly paycheck (before taxes), and he is ready to rap. “Straight bars,” he announces at the top of “POP,” before making good on that promise with the kind of stream-of-consciousness spree we haven’t heard since Lil Wayne’s mixtape heyday. Listening to this song is like living in a Sonic the Hedgehog speedrun—it’s zany, breakneck, and features a surprising number of ’90s references (congratulations My Cousin Vinny and Cindy Crawford, you are now Uzi-approved). Over an intergalactic beat that churns and gurgles like Jabba the Hutt with an upset stomach, Uzi rifles through flex after flex about everything from his gleaming fists to his minty-fresh dick to his (why not) “multi, multi, multi, multi, multi-grain” granola bars. It’s a direct line into one of music’s nimblest minds.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_28,2020,If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know),Quinn Moreland,"“If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know)” is the 1975 incarnate. A minefield of modern neuroses laid over top of a euphoric blast of ’80s schmaltz (complete with a bombastic saxophone solo), it’s a snapshot of what the band does best: grandiose uncertainty. This time, Matty Healy is hung up on the “girl of your dreams,” who he can only connect with via FaceTime. “I need to get back, I’ve gotta see the girl on the screen,” he announces. But time and time again, his efforts to rendezvous with his digital paramour are interrupted by real-life obstacles, from locked hotel rooms to the awkwardness of online intimacy. “If You’re Too Shy” doesn’t find any resolution to these problems, but rarely does disconnect sound so good.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_27,2020,Loner,Abby Jones,"Though the solitude that Chicago indie rockers Dehd invoke in “Loner” is self-imposed, this anti-breakup-song became a fitting soundtrack to a time of little human connection. Over beachy guitar riffs and bouncy hand claps, singer-bassist Emily Kempf expresses a desire to detach herself from the limitations of relationships, painting separation as a bittersweet opportunity for growth. The difference between independence and loneliness, Dehd suggest, is your relationship with yourself.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_26,2020,Laugh Now Cry Later,Isabelia Herrera,"The world might not need a song of triumph from Drake in 2020, but when he steps into the role of self-aware charmer, it’s hard to resist. On “Laugh Now Cry Later,” Champagne Papi slips on his silk robe, so unperturbed by old feuds that he’s willing to be publicly annihilated by Marshawn Lynch and Kevin Durant in the video. The video and brassy horn production are punctuated by knowing looks, swaggering “baby” ad-libs, and long overdue roses for Chicago drill legend Lil Durk. It’s Drake’s reminder that he can be cool-headed and breezy, a form he excels at. Even this stylish opportunist has still got some charisma left.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_25,2020,hand crushed by a mallet (remix),Jillian Mapes,"You might consider this as kind of like one of those pop-punk covers of turn-of-the-millennium hits gone spectacularly right. And given that the artists responsible are gecs, one of the slipperiest, most brilliant-dumb acts going, it’s both more and less complicated than that. Sure, the remix unites two iconic wailers of the 2000s Alternative Press set—Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump and Chiodos’ Craig Owens—for arresting vocal turns that transport you back about 15 years. But as the barbed guitar riffs and methodical bass plucks give way to a chorus made for a hot-pink dressing room montage scene played at 1.5x speed, and a happy hardcore breakdown devolves into a spiky loop of unclean vocals, it becomes clear that the remix is somehow even more amazingly chaotic (and infinitely catchier) than the cyber hellscape that is the original.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_24,2020,Robber,Jamieson Cox,"“Robber” unfurls like a cerebral crime drama, the kind that lures you in with a moody pilot and leaves you glued to your couch until you figure out whodunnit. Tamara Lindeman sketches out a villain—the titular thief, silent and cool—before lifting the veil on larger forces at work: laws, banks, a rotten system that forces people to act in their own self-interest. The song’s rhythm is insistent and unsteady; saxophone and electric guitar spray like seafoam, wild and untamed at the edges. By the time ""Robber"" reaches its urgent climax, Lindeman has transformed a personal reckoning with societal failures into a reflective prompt for the listener. Can you blame yourself for ruthlessness if you were never given a choice?",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_23,2020,Blinding Lights,Alex Frank,"The Weeknd’s misanthropic, bacchanalian persona was ahead of its time when he broke through in 2012, but with druggy nihilism essentially one of the unifying moods of 2020, Abel Tesfaye’s album After Hours felt freshly urgent in ways both enjoyable and horrifying. “Blinding Lights” was its rallying cry, a cold New Wave song about a protagonist so detached and listless that clamoring to turn his obsessive carnal fantasies into reality is all that appeases him. Max Martin’s polish helped make it a number one single for four weeks, the hurried drumbeat, surging choruses, and neon ‘80s synth allowing Tesfaye’s falsetto the euphoric if grinding edge of an amphetamine high. But it’s also easy to hear the broader spiritual resonance in this ode to a lonely man with little joy left except for intoxicants and the object of his desire.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_22,2020,What’s Your Pleasure?,Katherine St. Asaph,"Jessie Ware and producer James Ford know their disco, but on “What’s Your Pleasure?” they not only pay tribute to classics like Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” but also to the era’s overall feeling of smoky sleaze. Atop a steely sequencer, Ware’s vocals swoop like the bell sleeve of a chiffon disco gown sweeping you toward the floor. While she luxuriates in the heady, horny stuff of the verses—of perfect symmetry and blown candles—the beat throbs with lockstep control, less feeling love than meaning business. For every spangly synth, there’s a bit of brass that growls in a beastlier key, or guitars that practically salivate. And if you listen closely, she finishes each chorus with a gleeful whoop, completing the homage: There’s no pleasure without fun.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_21,2020,For You,Shawn Reynaldo,"With euphoria in short supply and dancefloors shuttered around the globe, 2020 hasn’t been particularly kind to dance music. Outside the context of booming sound systems and late-night revelry, even the most expertly crafted club tracks have lost some of their luster, which makes the glittering elation of “For You” all the more precious. Bounding along atop a turbo-charged filter-house template, the song gleefully reanimates the ghosts of French touch and harkens back to the days when house producers regularly (and rightfully) landed in the Top 40. As the title track of Jordan’s For You EP—an effort reflecting the London artist’s struggle to move past the homophobia and small-mindedness that pervaded their formative years in the North of England—the song is a joyous ode to self-love and self-acceptance that underscores the healing power of a good rave.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_20,2020,Lost One,Clover Hope,"Jazmine Sullivan has a gift for eulogizing relationships that are beyond saving, and even beyond possibility. On “Lost One,” a crackly ballad that concedes to the slipperiness of time, she confesses into an abyss about the sting of falling short in a partnership. Anguish turns to grief as Sullivan’s hoarse, fragile vocals retreat into a guitar that sounds as hollow as her defenses, landing somewhere between gospel and otherworldly. The song is profoundly sad because it isn’t a two-way dialogue between souls—it’s a soliloquy. The beauty of the song lies in the author’s awareness of the imbalance at hand. From the very beginning, she knows she’s singing to an apparition.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_19,2020,anything,Jayson Greene,"Adrianne Lenker’s music feels like a whisper even when her band screams behind her, and on her solo music, that whisper is pinpoint-accurate; listening to her sing feels like a tap on the shoulder. “Anything” is another one of her simple, warm folk songs, just another drop in the larger reservoir of work that seems to live within her. The vocal melody encompasses a range you could find under one hand on the piano, just a few notes, while her fingerpicking works its familiar, comforting magic. The lyrics are a series of simple affirmations and intimate scenes that express Lenker’s ongoing plea, audible in every breath, for a connection that transcends the bounds of talking. “Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking,” she sings. “I don’t wanna talk about anything.” The song makes space for the kind of silence she craves, the kind held by two people.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_18,2020,Both of Us,Madison Bloom,"There were so very few reasons to break out in ecstatic dance this year, but Jayda G offered a sublime exception. The London-based producer dropped her bubbly single “Both of Us” mid-summer, and it felt like being rescued by a party barge while lost at sea. Bright, bouncing keys are the driving force of her spirited house banger, but what happens on the song’s perimeter is just as entrancing. Dry, papery beats, synchronized claps, and muffled chit-chat lend the atmosphere of a packed, pulsing nightclub—and the molasses-slow breakdown offers one of the best beat-drop payoffs of the year. After months of inertia, Jayda G brought the dancefloor to us.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_17,2020,Delete Forever,Anna Gaca,"Grimes’ vision of our technologically mediated future is either marvelously prescient or totally wrong, but inside the elaborate cryogenic chambers of her albums, everything goes her way. Until “Delete Forever.” Here, in the misfit of Miss Anthropocene, a loose, extremely un-Grimes acoustic guitar strum becomes the setting for an affecting tribute to friends and fellow artists who’ve died in the opioid crisis. It’s not a testimonial; it’s a fragile meditation on lost innocence, surrender, and the contradictions of trauma. “Funny how they think us naive when we’re on the brink,” she sings in a high, crystalline coo. Some might find it crass to describe death in the same words as a wiped hard drive, but, well, this is still Grimes. “Delete Forever” extends the kind of empathy no AI can.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_16,2020,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,Allison Hussey,"The title of Fiona Apple’s spectacular fifth album is a call to “fetch your tool of liberation [and] set yourself free,” and its title track captures the cautious jubilation of accomplishing that feat. It opens with percussion that sounds like a rapping at the door, a wake-up call. Apple shakes off the burden of expectations and demarcates her own growth, building toward a Kate Bush-worthy insistence that she’ll make it up her hill. After a raft of heavy breaths, barking dogs, and a pounding-heart bassline that convey the frazzled yet determined energy of finding your footing, the song ends with a twinkling flourish of keys—a playful ta-da underscoring the realization that a broken lock is just the beginning.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_15,2020,Do It,Eric Torres,"Chloe x Halle polished their slinky R&B formula this year on sophomore album Ungodly Hour, and “Do It” was the duo’s glittering crown jewel. Their rich, fluttering harmonies pirouette over trap snares, finger snaps, and wobbling bass, all the while painting a portrait of a perfectly unbothered night out with friends. Light on its feet and effervescent, “Do It” is the sound of Chloe x Halle gracefully gliding across a vocal tightrope, with each sweetened back-and-forth accented by fabulous self-confidence.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_14,2020,4 American Dollars,Arielle Gordon,"Meghan Remy wears the perfectionist swagger of American pop like a disguise. Her stylistic shifts might seem willfully evasive, but as she puts it on ""4 American Dollars,"" ""It's not personal, it's business."" The song is a standout from Heavy Light, her sauntering, sensuous seventh album as the frontwoman of U.S. Girls, which revels in the sounds of hard-fought freedom—gospel, blues, Springsteen—utilizing their easy familiarity as a Trojan horse for materialist critique. With sky-high synths and a girl-group chorus, “4 American Dollars” drapes her daggers in velvetine funk. “No matter how much you get to have/You will still die, and that's the only fact,” she coos, sugar-coating capitalism’s alienation. Inverting a quote from Martin Luther King Jr., “4 American Dollars” accessorizes the trappings of a rags-to-riches mindset: “You gotta have boots if you wanna lift those bootstraps.”",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_13,2020,circle the drain,Jeremy D. Larson,"If asked to pinpoint the primary emotional experience of quarantine, you might go with listlessness, or fatigue. But neither quite nails it. With a bit more prodding to open up, maybe you’d land on: I’ve been falling apart these days. Sophia Allison of Soccer Mommy nailed our constant recursion, atrophy, isolation, gall, and grief back in the early spring. It’s more than just the chorus lyric of “circle the drain,” the lead single from Allison’s synesthetic indie rock album Color Theory; it’s how she sings it. The line’s path is dizzying, catching an updraft on falling apart, that feeling of rust as our sweatpants become thinner with wear. Then it floats back down and alights on these days, the great borderless period of time in which we find ourselves. The song’s warm familiarity, which Allison modeled in part after bright pop-rock hits of her youth, like Sheryl Crow’s “Soak up the Sun” or Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn,” gives it the quality of a quilt filled with stones. It’s comforting but heavy, the weight of the world on your chest—even, as Allison reminds us, when everything is fine.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_12,2020,Cut Me,Alfred Soto,"On his sophomore album græ’s first true song, Moses Sumney wields his falsetto like a lancer: He thrusts in unexpected directions and blocks when necessary. “Masochistic kisses are how I thrive,” he croons, staking a position as someone who revels in pain because they’re otherwise not long for this world. But Sumney, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Adult Jazz’s arrangement doesn’t let listeners get comfortable. The five-note synth bass serves as the foundation to a track of spiraling complexity keyed to the Ghanaian-American singer’s descents and swoops: a piano here, a horn there, as precise as punctuation. “Guess I’m a true immigrant son/No vacancies, no vacations,” he sings, resigned but resilient.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_11,2020,Rain on Me,Amy Phillips,"Following detours into Tony Bennett-style crooning, lightly country-fried rock, and Oscar-winning melodrama, Lady Gaga made her ferocious return to the club with the all-bangers-no-ballads Chromatica. On an album centered in dance music’s ability to heal, “Rain on Me” is the apex, a group therapy session disguised as a turn-of-the-millennium Euro-house floor-filler. Gaga’s lusty bravado and Ari’s airy coos complement each other perfectly as they sing about the restorative power of uncontrollable sobbing. No tears left to cry? That’s so 2018. In 2020, it’s all tears, all the time.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_10,2020,Fire,Puja Patel,"It begins like a faithful car being jump-started to make the last leg of a long trip; a spark of life followed by relief. Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield is driving with her partner through a Memphis sunset when a realization strikes, and on its face, “Fire” is a piercing love song that chases after the brief brilliance of the day right as it settles into sleep. But it also wears a graceful disguise. Warm, lo-fi keys and a loosely strummed guitar cushion the restlessness of self-work and sobriety, as she plainly states that she’ll “put on a good show for you.” Her voice crackles as she wrestles with the precarity of declaring acceptance—what it means to give it to yourself, to others—and the nerves of speaking a truth in shared company. By the end she recognizes there’s hope in the dark, too.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_9,2020,Garden Song,Vrinda Jagota,"On her debut album Stranger in the Alps, Phoebe Bridgers stopped analyzing her dreams. “I don’t believe in that stuff anymore,” she admitted in “Funeral,” a song about being consumed by the tragedy of a classmate’s death. Bridgers has said that her first album documented her trauma, while her second, this year’s Punisher, is about understanding how she processes it. So on its lead single, “Garden Song,” Bridgers is dissecting her dreams again, delving into her subconscious to understand what she wants and what it feels like to actually get it. Buoyed by plucky guitar and Bridgers’ bare, delicate vocals, the song gently folds time—and the evolution of desire—on itself like a baker kneading dough. One minute, Bridgers is a self-assured 17-year-old; then, in a recurring dream, a college student yearning for sex; then an adult tending to the garden she’s always wanted. There’s no real beginning or resolution, just flickers of past memories, longing, and anxiety patched together like her mind’s own hedge maze. And while moments of glimmering contentment emerge from the fog, eventually reality seeps in: the garden she’s cultivated will forever be haunted.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_8,2020,Describe,Cat Zhang,"When you are swallowed into the pitch black of your misery, who do you reach for? On “Describe,” Mike Hadreas stumbles through a depressive sludge, choked by thrashing, polluted guitars. There is goodness on the other side, but he can’t make out its shape. “Can you just wait here with me?” he pleads with his partner. It’s a moving portrait of love amid torment; the tenderness Hadreas receives is “like ribbons,” slivers of loveliness to press up against his cheek. Eventually, he emerges from the wreckage into a clearing, holding still in the soft glow of the final minutes. The most pristine love, he suggests, is found as a whisper back in the dead of the night.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_7,2020,Gospel for a New Century,Noah Yoo,"On “Gospel for a New Century,” Yves Tumor preaches the freedom to exist as they are. That means fully inhabiting their newfound rock star persona and doing away with the thin line between art and artifice. In one moment, Yves is dragging serrated horn samples across cavernous guitars; in the next, they’re casually settling into a groove worthy of Prince. This is a love song at its core but, facing down the barrel of this year, its sense of longing resonates further than that. “How much longer till December?” Yves asks at the end of the chorus. However far away, it can’t come soon enough.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_6,2020,Murder Most Foul,Matthew Strauss,"Bob Dylan set the stage for “Murder Most Foul” three-and-a-half years ago with a winding speech in acceptance of his Nobel Prize in Literature: For nearly a half hour, he blithely mused about the songs, musicians, and books that have influenced him over muted lounge piano. At 17 minutes, “Murder Most Foul” is similarly extended and retrospective—the 79-year-old slowly spins a story that orbits around the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy while rattling off many of America’s finest musicians along the way. As usual, there’s an ungraspable wisdom to Dylan’s meditations here, like he’s seeing something we cannot. Sung over the simplest of orchestral accompaniments, his words spill out and burn like a fever dream, as if they were bestowed unto him—or maybe he’s just associating as he goes. The historical gravity of his words are balanced with a pat rhyme scheme and self-reflexive lines like, “I’m just a patsy like Patsy Cline.” The poetry and loaded allusions come with levity. With “Murder Most Foul,” Dylan turns to a defining event of the 20th century to reveal that history is always happening right in front of our eyes, bringing with it everything that’s come before and everything that will soon be. His American tale is one of distraction, humor, and endless curiosity. The meaning of it all is right there in plain sight. Take what you’d like.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_5,2020,Safaera,Sheldon Pearce,"There isn’t a single wasted moment on “Safaera,” Bad Bunny’s epic homage to old-school perreo culture. The five-minute song is an all-consuming aesthetic maelstrom that is continually transforming; each beat change connects another link in a chain of references, establishing a masterful reggaetón timeline. With the energy of an intuitive DJ mix, producers Tainy and DJ Orma pieced together a whirlwind of a track as evocative for longtime fans of the genre as it is educational for newcomers. Standing confidently at the center of the saga is Bad Bunny himself. Amid the near-constant chaos of the song’s sonic shifts, he is resolute, moored firmly by his commitment to the music that he loves and the history held within it.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_4,2020,Savage Remix,Mankaprr Conteh,"The “Savage Remix” leak hit in April like an intravenous drip of caffeine and glitter, lifting the masses out of their doldrums, if only for four minutes. Megan Thee Stallion had only grown as a beacon of that-bitch-ism since 2019, but joined by one of the 21st century’s greatest entertainers, she became bolder. In their verses on the remix, Meg and Bey owned their sex appeal, their smarts, and their success, inviting you to own yours, too. In the months that followed, Megan would go from joyously dancing to the track in her kitchen, to performing it on an elaborate dystopian stage in the desert, to making a heart-wrenching political statement with it at 30 Rock. After Megan had been shot, mocked, and gaslit, the “Savage Remix” evolved from a confident anthem to an assertion of her complex, endangered humanity.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_3,2020,I Want You to Love Me,Jazz Monroe,"On Fetch the Bolt Cutters, Fiona Apple skewers romantic orthodoxy with such flair that you might wonder why anyone ever bothers with it to begin with. The answer comes in the album’s overture, a beguiling love song of blossoming arpeggios and Philip Glass pinwheels. In the chorus, anxiety stirs and a half bar sinkholes like a lost summer; in the lyrics, Apple is radically direct, like the master painter whose final act is to draw a simple straight line. She has forged through lust, betrayal, and heartbreak to reach this beginning—to ask, in the plainest terms, to be loved. Since the song’s debut in 2013, the identity of its “you” has flitted between real lovers and “somebody I hadn’t met yet,” Apple has said. It makes for a funny muse, this “you,” trembling through a chorus possessed equally of fierce desire and trepidation. As her coo whips into a snarl, Apple looks to metaphysics for solace, yet finds little: Spiritual wisdom, she learns, is no remedy for her primal desire to desire, to “want somebody to want.” For decades, Apple has penned damning chronicles of toxic romances. “I Want You to Love Me” suggests a limit to their power: They cannot make her love any less.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_2,2020,"People, I’ve been sad",Puja Patel,"Plenty of languages have a word for the nostalgic longing that comes with grief: in Portuguese, “saudade” articulates it while romanticizing the pain of absence. Shades of meaning separate the similarly despaired Romanian “dor,” the Russian “toska,” the more heartened Japanese “natsukashii.” Ethiopian “tizita” is a musical genre born from this melancholic feeling, as are the American “blues.” But in the overwhelming chaos of 2020, and coincidentally from the land that gave us “ennui,” Christine and the Queens’ Héloïse Letissier captured the many heartaches of a world in pain via a word so universal you can’t help but laugh: “People, I’ve been sad.” In the song, she conjures the emotion with gravitas and synth-pop charm. Backed by sauntering keys and quivering strings, Letissier sings in her native French about teenage loneliness and angst. On the chorus, she pleads for presence and permanence. The lines are delivered with a confessional vulnerability, as ghostly vocals echo her own in support. You can practically feel a distance being bridged between her voice and the microphone, and between despondent fans across the globe.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2020_1,2020,WAP,Clover Hope,"Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion rapped such a rich tapestry of filth on “WAP” that it earned a face-breaking 93 million streams in its first week and immediately went No. 1. This wasn’t a mere lyrical double-team, but two women in their career prime overpowering pop with a raw anthem attuned to the very specific frequency of certain pandemic urges; the rare instant hit that exists as a trend and future monument. Of the many words that could describe their duet—dirty, vulgar, nasty, explicit—none come anywhere close to capturing the attitude of the acronym itself. Over the tremors of a Baltimore club classic, “Whores in This House,” Cardi and Megan forgo euphemisms entirely (“I wanna gag,” etc.) to present an airtight case in favor of women expressing full-bodied lust. Megan presumably stands before an appellate court to do so, admitting, “Your Honor, I’m a freak bitch,” while a Cardi verse somehow tributes the unsung uvula amid an imposing tour de force of lecherous metaphors. “WAP” is so decisively absent of shame that it’s now positioned alongside similar anthems by the likes of Khia, Lil’ Kim, and Trina. It’s as resonant as it is unreachable: consider that, in a year of fairly learnable TikTok challenges, the dance for “WAP” asks that you transition from a floor-hump to a windmill split. It’s a feat that the song exists at all, encapsulating a year in which women have been leading both the statistics and conscience of rap, and even forced conservative talking heads to contend with the extraordinary power of the word “pussy.”",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2020,Pitchfork
2021_100,2021,"I am not a woman, I’m a god",Katherine St. Asaph,"More than any other track on Halsey’s career-best LPIf I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power,“I am not a woman, I’m a god” embodies the bitter resignation of the album’s title: detachment as a mask for self-loathing. Taking the come-closer-go-away themes of previous songs like “Alone” and turning them post-apocalyptic, Halsey likens themself to a distant sort of god, an alt-pop Doctor Manhattan surveying their emotional wasteland of botched connections and might-have-been selves and finding nothing savable. Producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross deliver their late-career coldest: an implacable sequence line, a metronomic beat, and a synth riff that prickles like a crown of thorns. Halsey vocalizes like they’re trying to outrun the thing they’re singing about, until the final chorus: a desperate belt with an abrupt end, the sounds their last few remaining feelings make before they’re soldered over.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_99,2021,Believer,Madison Bloom,"Smerz, the electronic project of Norwegian songwriters Henriette Motzfeldt and Catharina Stoltenberg, released its debut full-length,Believer, early this year. The album’s cold, creeping title track is among the duo’s finest work: The song teeters on jagged synths and rattling polyrhythms, while strings surge from behind at gale force. Stoltenberg’s voice is small and slightly processed, a mechanical purr that somehow feels both vulnerable and detached. Her clipped dispatches on love are pragmatic and icy, but beguiling enough to lure you through each disorienting curve.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_98,2021,Bottle Episode,Paul A. Thompson,"“Bottle Episode” is repetition weaponized. The single by the Manchester-based Mandy, Indiana marches brusquely from pocket to pocket, its pacing urgent, its drums military. But it’s Valentine Caulfield’s lyrics that form the most compelling loops—the ones that upend the song’s tone. Each short verse ends with a single repeating line; some, when read straight, would be too grim to maintain the song’s relentless groove (“Sous le feu et sous les balles/Les hommes dansent quasiment,” roughly translated: “As the bullets hit them/The men dance, almost”). Yet Caulfield infuses them with a perverse playfulness, allowing you to imagine, against your better judgment, how that choreography might look.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_97,2021,Last Day on Earth,Jamieson Cox,"Bea Kristi wrote “Last Day on Earth” soon after COVID-19 lockdowns began by imagining how she would’ve spent her last “normal” day. It sounds like a rom-com writing prompt, with music to match: irresistible guitar-pop jangle, a giddy wordless hook, soft backing vocals from the 1975’s Matty Healy. But the song’s sweet self-referentiality takes it someplace unexpected. Instead of looking for love or throwing a rager, Bea wanders around her house naked and alone, obsessing over a song that’s “so fucking sick” even as she’s too drunk to finish the lyrics. That’s where the hook comes in: When you have a golden riff and a perfect melody, there's nothing wrong with singingshoop-do-badooand calling it a day.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_96,2021,Being Honest,Paul A. Thompson,"Bronx teenager Kay Flock has the voice of a much older man, suitable for projecting menace and hinting at relentless pain. It’s reminiscent of G Herbo, when the Chicago rapper was pioneering drill nearly a decade ago. Herbo solidified this connection by showing up on a remix of “Being Honest,” but it’s the original, solo version of the track that gives Kay Flock the most space to express his tormented worldview. The song’s verses are stark, filled with loneliness and missed calls and death, all atop a sample of the late XXXTentacion’s “changes” made to sound as if it were an unearthed pop relic from the ’60s. In a year when New York’s mutation of drill seemed to be stagnating, Kay Flock injected it with new life.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_95,2021,Look,Arielle Gordon,"A girl walks home alone at night: There are horror films written about the sheer anxiety that scenario evokes. But on her effervescent single “Look,” Doss subverts the threat. Defiant in her confident solitude, she dares us to, well, look. “You see me, on my own,” she sings in a robotic register, before a rubbery, slightly sinister synth counters. “Look” is grimy and grotesque, with wobbly basslines and EDM-style drops. Like a rave in a funhouse mirror, its rhythms are as disorienting as they are danceable. Her lyrics share that shifting perspective, transferring power between the observer and the observed. “I can do it on my own,” she insists, over and over again. By the end, it’s impossible to tell if the dip in her voice is out of fear or excitement, but either way, we’re transfixed.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_94,2021,Get Into It (Yuh),Alphonse Pierre,"The best Doja Cat singles work their way into your brain, and then, when you least expect it, involuntarily funnel back out through your vocal cords. On “Get Into It (Yuh),” it’s the way she bends her voice on the hook, going from a croaky whisper to a sweet-sounding chant. Then there’s the light, dreamy melody that’s perfect to whistle along to. The only problem is, when you sing it back to yourself, it won’t sound nearly as good.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_93,2021,Time Travel,Brandon Callender,"Mavi’s 2019 recordLet the Sun Talkwas a spiritual journey of self-discovery and Black liberation that established the North Carolina artist as a leader of rap’s underground vanguard. Two years later, he sounds hungrier than ever, suffering no fools. On “Time Travel,” he narrates the battle between his ego and insecurities. “Often I be embarrassed over how brazen I be,” he raps over shimmering keys, “but it beats bein’ embarrassed over how lazy they be.” For nearly four minutes, he breathlessly runs through references both Biblical and mythological in between nods to Nickelodeon cartoons and his beloved hometown Charlotte Hornets, painting a self portrait that feels both superhuman and achingly relatable.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_92,2021,Little Deer,Jenn Pelly,"Bay Area art-pop sorcerer Tia Cabral of SPELLLING reintroduced herself with “Little Deer,” the surging baroque opener of her fantastical third albumThe Turning Wheel. Evoking the audacious spirits of forebears like Minnie Riperton and Kate Bush, it is a fable-like tale of death and rebirth, of the never-quite-finished process of being a person. Joined by over a dozen musicians—brass, strings, woodwinds, conga, a choir—Cabral brings pop formalism and the questing spirit of ’70s soul orchestration into SPELLLING’s world, making a majestic entry into her sharpest album yet.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_91,2021,We Don’t Have to Talk About It,Ryan Dombal,"Here’s an R&B ballad for the ghosted, by the ghosted. Snoh Aalegra, whose elegant vocals and tight ponytail have inspired enough comparisons to Sade to causea minor Twitter controversy, is trying to navigate the frustrations of a one-sided relationship. She wants to respect her partner’s silence even as she’s haunted by what’s been left unsaid. Atop roomy production that mirrors the empty space she’s wading through, Aalegra sounds both poised and vulnerable—straight-faced with a single tear running down. She can’t force him to talk about what’s wrong. But he can’t stop her from singing about it, either.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_90,2021,All Futures,Ian Cohen,"“All Futures” introducedULTRAPOPas the Armed’s fourth album, and also as a one-band genre: a deliberate attempt to fashion post-hardcore’s most extremist tendencies into something thrillingly accessible. In alive-performance videothat has become the song’s definitive version, the band flexed the results of the absurdnutrition and exercise regimenthey’d followed for the previous year, a sort of conceptual stunt aimed at visually matching the maxed-out heroism of the music. Absolutely ripped, dwarfing their instruments, they pummel out massive hooks amid organized chaos. These facets are inseparable for the Armed, a band that has dedicated its confounding existence to highbrow myth-making on one hand, and on the other, shit that immediately sounds and looks fucking awesome.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_89,2021,Boing Beat,Colin Joyce,"MC Boing, the pitched-up voice on Danny L Harle’s post-trance rave-up “Boing Beat,” is a blobby blue cartoon character that looks likea cross between Crazy Frog and a character from a Red Bull commercial. Such absurd imagery suits the song’s delirious swirl of internet-addled Eurodance refractions and pitched-up sugar-rush rapping, which is credited to the animated avatar. The euphoric, otherworldly track arrived in January, while clubs across the world were still shuttered and the long nights out that “never, never, never end” were still a distant dream. Though dancefloors have filled back up, the music’s yearning is still palpable—few songs better capture the feeling of desperately straining for an ecstatic experience that’s just out of reach.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_88,2021,Many Times,Pete Tosiello,"If “Many Times” is a song about needing space, Dijon manages to use every available inch. It unfolds in the moments after a breakup, leaving the R&B-inflected singer-songwriter grasping at straws, his multi-tracked vocals growing progressively more agitated across two verses. A series of structural pivots—claustrophobic percussion giving way to a roomier chorus—mirror the narrative’s emotional trajectory, with a lively piano outro lending a glimmer of hope.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_87,2021,better,Shawn Reynaldo,"Presented as a mixtape, Joy Orbison’s long-awaited debut full-length,Still Slipping Vol. 1, is meant to be consumed as a complete, luscious whole, but album highlight “better” beautifully encapsulates the UK producer’s timeless brand of post-dubstep street soul. Dreamily drifting along the edge of the dancefloor, the track rests atop a bed of plush deep house that recalls the pillow-soft sounds of Larry Heard; its silky, dimly lit groove centers the R&B-infused vocals of fellow Londoner Léa Sen, who delivers a heart-twisting tale of late-night longing.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_86,2021,2 You,Anna Gaca,"The heartbreak Mariah the Scientist sings about in “2 You” is the kind that doesn’t fade for years. Against a dreamy mosaic of a cappella fragments, she reminisces about a lover who drifted away, about how the only thing she regrets more than letting this one go was not leaving sooner. “But look at what we made/Sure was beautiful,” she sings, voice soaring up from a well of emotions heavy as gravity, a heaping stack of harmonies to tell you how her heart went threadbare. After all this time, she still can’t quite explain it: “Whenever they play our song/Don’t know why I feel ashamed.”",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_85,2021,Twerkulator,Ivie Ani,"“Twerkulator” fuses regions, eras, and sounds, weaving samples from Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force’s foundational 1982 electro-rap record “Planet Rock” and Cajmere’s 1992 house touchstone “The Percolator” into a beat that throws back to the blunt minimalism of Miami bass music. Incorporating all that history made it tougher to put out—after a leaked version went viral on TikTok in 2020, sample clearance issues delayed its proper release for a year—but it also practically guaranteed its power. “Pop that pussy on some Luke shit,” Yung Miami instructs on the song, offering another nod to raunchy rap pioneer Uncle Luke. Even with this amalgam of references, the City Girls’ stamp still rings loud and clear.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork

2021_83,2021,Damaged,Bhanuj Kappal,"Leo Bhanji doesn’t write songs so much as assemble musical Frankenstein’s monsters—malformed skeletal prototypes whose guts and wiring he does not attempt to polish or hide. “Damaged” is willfully oblique in its collage of lo-fi pop, R&B, hip-hop, church music, and UK dance, with sounds that mutate in response to Bhanji’s stream-of-consciousness vocals. As the London artist's voice shifts between King Krule mumble and Auto-Tuned croon, the beat shifts with him—capturing both the anxiety and the acceptance of an intimate late-night epiphany.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_82,2021,Rare to Wake,Lane Brown,"“I’m longing to grow,” sings L.A. folkie Shannon Lay on “Rare to Wake,” a ballad that traces the hinge between fear of personal transformation and excitement for it. Lay’s multi-tracked harmonies fall at soft angles over finger-picked acoustic guitar and meandering electric piano, until a dynamic swell announces a transition that never comes. The arrangement, like the song itself, seems to fidget with anticipation, finding beauty at an uncertain precipice.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_81,2021,Gët Busy,Mano Sundaresan,"“This song already was turnt but here’s a bell,” Yeat raps about halfway through this track, before firing off a massive gonging sound that’s become the Portland artist’s trademark. Zoom out from that moment, though, and there’s a lot more to enjoy here: mini vocal freakouts full of garbled drug concoctions; Dr. Seuss references; twizzies, tizzies, and Lizzies. Cutting his teeth in the influential online rap collective Slayworld over the last few years, Yeat was always a little stranger than his peers, and consequently cast as a minor figure.

2021_79,2021,Quotations,Kelly Liu,"Water From Your Eyes’ ““Quotations”” manages to seem offhanded and rigorous at once, moving restlessly but with almost neurotic precision. As the Brooklyn art-pop duo stitches disconnected observations—legs stretching on grass, something in the air flying by—the music comes together as an alien collage, with errant elements meticulously arranged: bubbly synths, fractured percussive clicks, a disorienting vocal loop, a sprawling breakbeat. When the track ascends to its abrupt ending, it is as though a portal has opened up, and we’re suddenly sucked back to reality.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork

He renders club rap bangers into acoustic ballads, compressing each recording to its emotional core.Black Metal 2offers some of the most accessible music of his career, and with “the rot” the artist approaches Britpop. Blunt’s intimate, monotone croon is familiar, but the sweeping strings and lightly twanging guitars are disarmingly luxurious.

Some of his favorite places to grab a snack are themichi no eki(service stations) which dot Japan’s highways—often sprawling campuses with spas, cafés, and farmers markets. Foodman pays tribute to these roadside oases on his 2021 albumYasuragi Land, and on “Parking Area,” he sketches a scenic view that might entice a weary traveler to pull over. His palette is more spacious than usual; a breezy, digitally altered guitar drives the melody, leaving more room for his nimble beats to ping-pong around than his often jam-packed tunes typically do. “Parking Area” invites you to take a moment to enjoy life’s simplest pleasures. Treat yourself. You deserve it.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork

The boys from Bradford have worked out what they do well (beers, bangers, bikes) and they’re sticking with it. “Don’t You Worry About Me” refines the formula: A whale-sized hook backed up with boisterous bars and a shot of humour to chase it down.

The twinkling funk of lead single “Gemini and Leo,” which was appropriately released on the summer solstice, radiates pure warmth.

She offers a few of the expected observations—blubbering worshipers, the cool pastor—but soon homes in on one other student: a poem-scrawling, nutmeg-abusing metalhead from a troubled family. “You were gonna win me over from the start,” she smiles, but her younger self is trying to winhim. Pinning effortless internal rhyme to the solemn strum of campfire praise, Dacus sketches her one-time boyfriend—and her attempts at saving his soul—with incisive resignation. “All it did, in the end,” she sighs, “was make the dark feel darker than before”",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_70,2021,All I Need,Linnie Greene,"Canadian house phenom Jayda G’s “All I Need” is dance music that feels like an out-of-body experience, untethering you from your most mundane worries. The lyrics are just empty enough to serve as an incantation (“Putting up, putting up our walls/I’ve given you all my worlds”) or a vessel, a container for whatever you’re exorcising on the dance floor. The retro melody evokes simpler times and simpler pleasures: sweat and oblivion, body and blood.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_69,2021,Wild Side,Michelle Kim,"Normani expresses her sensuality on “Wild Side” as if it’s simmering just beneath the surface, the promise of an explosion that never arrives. The song’s allure is in its restraint, the way her voice, breathy yet commanding, matches the push-and-pull of the skittering beat. When Cardi B arrives, claiming she can “suck a watermelon through a straw,” it’s a moment of raunch that brings balance to a curiously subtle R&B hit.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_68,2021,Mystery,Ian Cohen,"When the return of live music started to feel a little less theoretical, two schools of thought emerged: Do we ease ourselves back in or wild the fuck out on sight? Turnstile considered all possibilities with “Mystery,” which obliges the hesitant with an introductory 20 seconds of welcoming synth bubbles and then reacquaints Turnstile’s audience with everything that’s made them synonymous with “You really gotta see it live to get it” hardcore: a rap-rock riff that moves to the exact rhythms of a sustainable headbang, a low-end punch capable of making peopleliterally lose their shit in the pit, and instantaneous quotables like “And it’s been so long!” delivered in Brendan Yates’ ocean-sized roar.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_67,2021,Xiu,Zhenzhen Yu,"秀 (xìu) is used as an English loanword, pronounced nearly like “show”—it can mean “excellent,” “elegant,” or “to show off, give a show.” Balanced on pentatonic synths that beam like carnival lights, Yu Su’s “Xiu” feels very much like that titular exhibition. The Chinese-born, Vancouver-based musician’s gentle ambient vocalizations layer like interlocking puzzle pieces over pulsating waves of drum’n’bass. As an opener, the song contrasts with the rest of the placidly flowingYellow River Blue, but it stands proudly on its own as a lush, energetic jump start.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_66,2021,Bussifame,Clover Hope,"The lead single from Dawn Richard’s fantastic electro festSecond Lineopens with a brief definition of the titular New Orleans dance style. In short, it’s all about the get-down. For the next four-and-a-half minutes, Richard lets the hi-hats and house rhythms swirl as she drops slick, stream-of-consciousness callouts like she just grabbed the mic at a club to amp partygoers leaving blood on the dancefloor. The record unravels into an elastic ball that invites you to move your feet and bust it, with one simple rule: close your eyes and be free.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_65,2021,Stonefruit,Raphael Helfand,"NYC rappers Elucid and billy woods have been making uncompromising music together as Armand Hammer since 2013, but this year’s collab with veteran producer the Alchemist,Haram, finds them at a rarified new level. The simple production on album closer “Stonefruit” centers a siren synth that sits just behind the beat of a triumphant drumroll and two repeating arpeggios. ELUCID matches the production with a gruff verse about love and its pitfalls, and billy woods follows from the opposite angle, gliding through thorny rhyme schemes (regalia, bougainvillea, marginalia) before zeroing in on the image of a woman who conquers and cannibalizes his body. If Armand Hammer’s brutal realism usually beats the listener into submission, “Stonefruit” is a fantastical balm for our wounds.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_64,2021,Fellowship,Vrinda Jagota,"On this jubilant ode to friendship, serpentwithfeet’s ethereal falsetto glistens like sunlight on a lake as he details the jokes and customs he shares with those closest to him: their “crafty looks when there’s nothing to wear” and “fascination with Prosecco.” He sings with generosity over warm percussion, making it feel like you’re immersed in an amber-hued movie montage. “Fellowship” is a high note onDEACON, which celebrates supportive relationships while embracing emotional growth. It suggests we worry less, and actively embrace love in every shape it takes.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_63,2021,I Lie Here Buried With My Rings and My Dresses,Dylan Green,"Rapper-producer Backxwash finds clarity in rage. The title track from her latest album channels rap, metal, and industrial into a tornado of pent-up anger, world history, and potent soul-searching. “The artistry that I’m giving, ghosted up in the matrix,” the Zambian-Canadian artist bellows. “Almost like our ancients weren’t posted up in the slave ships.” Confronting sinister specters of the past, she offers an exorcism that’s both aggressive and beautiful.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_62,2021,MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name),NM Mashurov,"Who among us could resist Lil Nas X riding a stripper pole into hell to give a lap dance to the devil? “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” was his most explicitly queer track to date, and the video is undeniable proof that he is one of the most creative, unpredictable artists working today. The song itself is more familiar but still thoroughly joyful: an upbeat, desperately escalating desire-spiral towards a bad-news hookup, elevated to high drama by banjo, flamenco guitar, and lusty humming.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_61,2021,23,Veracia Ankrah,"Musically, “23” sounds like the best part of the summer, with a harp, chirping birds, and sunny vocal harmonies. But lyrically, it’s a somber reflection on UK singer-songwriter Cleo Sol’s relationship with her mother, occasioned by the birth of her own daughter. It all adds up to one cathartic exhale, as Sol attempts to release her mother from the burden of failing to meet her goals while promising to do better herself. “The little stars and the locked up dreams,” she sings, “the missing pieces, they’re in me.”",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_60,2021,Sick Bitch,Cat Zhang,"LSDXOXO cuts straight to the point on “Sick Bitch,” an immaculately filthy statement of intent: “I’m a sick bitch/And I like freak sex/If you want to test the limits of my gag reflex,” the Berlin-based producer growls coolly. It’s techno for the sluts who’ll emerge from all-night dick appointments with their eyeliner still looking immaculate. Over a bed of dial-tone synths, thumping kicks, and laser zaps, LSDXOXO goads someone to “go berserk” and deliver on rough sex; the pièce de résistance is cut-up moans that simulate being edged, culminating in blissed-outaaaaahhhs. It’s not for the faint of heart, but “Sick Bitch” contains so much pleasure.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_59,2021,Dogma,Grayson Haver Currin,"A dear friend’s death, a lonely artist residency, an intractable bout of writer’s block: Circuit des Yeux mastermind Haley Fohr was having a hell of a hard go of things. “Dogma,” the militantly lithe rock track on -io, an album of otherwise pillowy orchestral dimensions, serves as Fohr’s stubborn note-to-self: Keep moving and keep busy, and you might just keep it together. “Tell me how to feel right/Tell me how to see the light,” she commands over drums so mighty they stanch the synthesizer din creeping beneath her. Through this forward motion, she cultivates the strength to survive, at least until answers about what’s next come easier.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_58,2021,Drama,Katherine St. Asaph,"“Drama” isn’t fights and fireworks. Against a skittering beat and guitar loop right out of one of Kandi and She’kspere’slate-’90sproductions, Erika de Casier insinuates vocal lines as nimble as Craig David and coy as Aaliyah. Her voice starts off processed and digitized, as if it’s coming from a clock radio, and she’s mic’d close to capture every purr. A fog of strings and chillout piano conjure up the pure moods, while de Casier murmurs decidedly impure propositions. Like much contemporary Y2K&B, “Drama” sounds dreamier and more delicate than the actual music of the past—fitting for this track about woozy late-night texts and the relationship rubble left behind.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_57,2021,Sad Girlz Luv Money Remix,Cat Zhang,"Nothing is sexier than a woman getting paid. “SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY,” a sleek standout from Amaraae’s 2020 debutThe Angel You Don’t Know, indulges in the pleasure of nabbing that “mula-la-la-la” and going dancing; the world-conquering remix featuring Colombian-American pop star Kali Uchis—which became a TikTok sensation and then hit the Billboard charts—only heightens the opulent sensuality. Uchis’ soft, lustrous vocals align seamlessly with Amaarae’s wispy falsetto and fellow Ghanaian-American singer Moliy’s airy purrs as they trade verses over the cool, rocking beat. “I really want to get naughty/I think you’re such a hottie,” Amaarae sings, ever so blunt and coquettish. It’s “fuck bitches, get money,” this time for the ladies.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_56,2021,Beating Down Yo Block,Shaad D’Souza,"On her viral single “Beating Down Yo Block,” Houston rapper Monaleo is dauntless and defiant, a brat and a boss, a benevolent leader and, potentially, the last thing you see before you meet your maker: “I’m pretty but I’ll take a n***a life and that’s the tea, bitch,” she raps in her take-no-shit Texas drawl. Born out of horrific struggle—the 20-year-old recorded the track as a way to gas herself up after leaving an abusive ex—“Beating Down Yo Block” is a beatific clapback. Another famed Houstonite once insisted thatthe best revenge is your paper, but Monaleo has another idea that could be even more effective: make a song he’ll never be able to escape, no matter how hard he tries.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_55,2021,Weights,Nina Corcoran,"On its surface, “Weights” is one of countless songs about clinging to a crush. In the hands of Bartees Strange, however, that familiar theme gets a redesign worthy of the pantheon. Armed with an explosive rhythm section and guitars aimed at the cheap seats, Bartees captures the most pivotal moment of post-relationship life—the decision to move on—through Bloc Party-style crescendos and throat-clearing howls. Think karaoke for the heartbroken desperately seeking confidence. Taken from the deluxe edition of his breakthrough 2020 albumLive Forever, “Weights” is a personal victory lap that basks in an adrenaline spike so strong that listeners can feel it, too.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_54,2021,Best Friend,Clover Hope,"Just a few years ago, mainstream collabs between women in rap were as rare as a genuine Notes app apology. Now, there’s anembarrassmentofriches, and “Best Friend” is one of those coups: two of rap’s most dominant merging to hype each other up, as good confidants do. (Who hasn’t spotted their Day One on the street and screamed, “Beep beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie”?) Over a beat that bounces like a pogo stick, Saweetie lobs bad-bitchisms at Doja Cat, whose masterful shapeshifting manifests as a bubbly, three-flow verse. As public displays of affection go, this is the kind that’s perfectly admissible.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_53,2021,Send Me,Philip Sherburne,"Stripped to synthesizer, voice, and the occasional sullen drumbeat, Tirzah’s albumColourgradedemonstrates a self-protective restraint. “Send Me” is among the record’s most spartan songs: A single guitar figure is looped over a rickety hi-hat pattern, practically without variation, for four minutes. Over this skeletal frame, Tirzah asks for healing. “Send me sun at dawn/Gonna let it heal some more,” she sings softly, as though cooing a lullaby to her newborn; the lyrics are both tender and cryptic. Then, in the final 30 seconds, she steps on a stomp box, and all that palliative energy suddenly goes up in flames.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_52,2021,Happier Than Ever,Olivia Horn,"For much of her sophomore album, Billie Eilish is subdued, rarely rising past a melodic whisper even when she’s spitting venom atstalkers,trolls, andabusers. At first, the record’s sprawling title track feels like more of the same: “Happier Than Ever” begins with wafty ukulele, twinkly keys, and Eilish’s cozy vibrato, her opening salvo so wistfully delivered that you almost miss its underlying spite. But midway through, Billie’s inner Alanis activates. She submits to rage and cranks the volume, summoning a torrent of fried guitar and muffled screams as she reams out an ex. “I don’t talk shit about you on the internet,” she wails, before proceeding to talk a whole lot of shit. It can be tempting to air your grievances online, but Eilish knows that her burns make better lyrics than tweets.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_51,2021,Introvert,Veracia Ankrah,"“Introvert” is the opening in a chilling, fantastical score where Little Simz is the messiah tasked with preventing evil from ending the world. Rather than sheer gospel, the song plays like theme music for a champion boxer jogging into the ring before Michael Buffer announces, “Let’s get ready to rumble!”—except the match is taking place at a cathedral over the sounds of church horns and bells. Simz vigilantly defends her title–over 10 years in the game–with steady, precise jabs: “I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church.” Here, she embraces being a loner and continues throwing bows, even if it means bad manners in the house of the Lord.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_50,2021,I Don’t Live Here Anymore,Sophie Kemp,"Adam Granduciel is looking back at the past and man, it looks so good. “I Don’t Live Here Anymore,” the sublime title track from the War on Drugs’ fifth record, is an anthem made for being covered in tanning oil on a roof while wearing aviators, or pumping your fist in the air from the back of a pickup truck. It’s iridescent, with varicolored synths and guitars as big as skyscrapers. He namedrops Dylan, and he sings about memory and how we all need to walk through “this darkness” on our own.There’s still a sense of sweet, sweet mystery in this life, he seems to say. It might sound corny, but he’s right.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_49,2021,Kelso (Blue sky),Arjun Srivatsa,"On “Kelso (Blue sky),” Liz Harris chauffeurs us along the desolate road of her internal struggle. While driving home on a rural highway beside the Columbia River, Harris is consumed by fog. Between pensive hums, she expresses her discontent as the light disappears around her. The sky turns dark and so do her emotions as she sings, “Can't beliеve that I don't get to see you one morе time.” She wants to tell us she’s happy, but at night she can only tell the truth.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_48,2021,Strawberry,Joshua Minsoo Kim,"Doss’ “Strawberry” begins with breath. It’s less like an inhalation that precedes singing and more like a sudden gasp for air, a sound befitting a track about realizing one’s self-worth. “Maybe this song believes you,” the New York musician whispers, as if revealing a secret. As her voice entwines with a sturdy beat, fairy-light synths, and the faintest hint of guitar fuzz, her anthropomorphizing feels like more than mere metaphor. Sound becomes a conduit for self-discovery—and for the revelation, “Maybe I could sing too.” “Strawberry” sits in a lineage of danceable shoegaze classics like “Soon” and “Pearl,” but it feels content with being simple,ephemeral: a refreshing morsel that’s unexpectedly life-giving.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_47,2021,"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 38",Gio Santiago,"Argentine rapper L-Gante’s “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 38” is the sticky smash driving a new urbano style called Cumbia 420 that operates at the intersection of cumbia, reggaeton, and weed. Earlier this year, the fiendish track topped Argentina’s pop chart, and it’s easy to hear why: L-Gante’s immaculately sinister croak cuts through a beat that incorporates EDM bombast and an addictivebrrrrrpsound effect that could be sourced from a Hans Zimmer movie score. He whizzes through local slang, rapping about the partying and women that make him feel powerful. You don’t have to be a stoner to appreciate the song, but L-Gante’s call to light aporrowith him and let go is undeniable all the same.",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_46,2021,Tales From the Trash Stratum,Simon Reynolds,"The original “Trash Stratum,” on 2020’sMagic Oneohtrix Point Never, entwined distortion and euphony in familiar Dan Lopatin fashion. This year’s reinvention lovingly collages ’80s production motifs: pizzicato string flutters as fragrant as Enya, blobs of reverb-smudged piano that evoke Harold Budd, high-toned pings of bass that could be the Blue Nile orSeventeen Seconds. Like a bowerbird building a glittering nest, he succeeds in reeling in onetime Cocteau Twin Elizabeth Fraser. Fraser’s contributions—ASMR-triggering wisps of sibilant breath, chirruping syllables from a disintegrated lullaby—are closer to a diva’s warm-up exercises than an actual aria, and sometimes you long for her to take full-throated flight into song. But it’s lovely to hear the goth goddess brought into the glitchy 21st century.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_45,2021,Good Ones,Cameron Cook,"“RIP hyperpop?” Charli XCX tweeted this summer, while teasing the release of this track. Charli’s forte has always been her deep understanding of pop music’s fickle undercurrents, and just as her sound was starting to become synonymous with vocoders and late ’90s/early ’00s nostalgia, she jumped ship to deliver the kind of dancefloor banger that forcibly lifts your soul straight out of your body and into the refracted light of a disco ball. Charli has spent the last decade shape-shifting from mainstream hitmaker to avant-garde darling; “Good Ones” sees her embarking on yet another chapter, winking at us with a rhinestone eyelash in the process.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_44,2021,American tterroristt,Alphonse Pierre,"On this nearly 10-minute barrage, the rambling and unpredictable RXKNephew reels off enough nonsensical conspiracy theories to make Joe Rogan think:This guy is really onto something!The wildest ones—about the COVID vaccine causing mutations and dinosaurs discovering electricity before Benjamin Franklin—might stand out at first, but keep listening. I mean, points are made here: The Bible does have a lot of plot holes! Algebra is some bullshit! And let’s face it, they knew Kelly Clarkson would winAmerican Idolall along! You might not want to elect Nephew to any school boards, but hear him out.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_43,2021,Peaches,Brian Josephs,"Justin Bieber’s sixth albumJusticewas a big leap from last year’sChangesbecause it broke out of the latter’s gnawingly inoffensive R&B to embrace Bieber’s multi-genre versatility. And yet, “Peaches,”Justice’s peak, is a pure R&B jam. At this point, Bieber has tossed so many bromides gesturing at a deep connection to faith and marital love, it’s become a defining quirk. But where words and MLK quotes fail on the album, “Peaches” hits because he leans on the sheer feeling of those aspirations. The swing of his delivery adds a shimmer to the production’s major-key bliss.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_42,2021,Chaeri,Ashley Bardhan,"Over a grumbling synth loop, singer Mica Tenenbaum asks, “Was I a bad friend?” and “I’m sorry/Did you feel lonely?” But “Chaeri” isn’t quite an apology, and Tenenbaum isn’t above some finger-pointing of her own—she urges her dour ally to be just a little happier. This is the hard conversation you had last year and then replayed in your head until you got it right—except the song ends before that all happens. Magdalena Bay relishes in the ache of just remembering.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_41,2021,Breadwinner,Julia Gray,"Kacey Musgraves’Star-Crossedis both a divorce album and a story of tragic romance, and “Breadwinner” is its central cautionary tale—the faint siren that divides the tracklist into two acts. With her gift for wordplay, Musgraves flips the traditional role of the “breadwinner” to invent a new character, a kind of male gold digger who’s flattered and then intimidated by a woman’s success. As his shine dulls, she sees his motives clearly. Musgraves’ roots ground her: A slight twang lingers amid her glittering synth and soft rock, more country-pop symbiosis than crossover. She’s shedding a love that weighed her down, gazing through the rearview mirror and driving forward.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_40,2021,MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA,Jillian Mapes,"On the lead single from her impressive second LP, Illuminati Hotties head Sarah Tudzin doesn’t just sing about the disorienting whiplash of modern existence—she simulates it. Shifting voices and tones like she’s driving stick in the Alps, Tudzin tosses everything together at full speed: nonsequiturs about late-stage capitalism, nihilistic onomatopoeia, possibly earnest requests to be choked, trolling of customer-service representatives. She toggles between punk chords in the verses and surf-rock hooks in the chorus, the music as brazen and impudent as her dispatches from the brink.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_39,2021,To Be Loved,Owen Myers,"On “To Be Loved” Adele zeros in on a relationship’s scars and scratches until there is blood. She has never controlled her vocals as precisely as on this minimal piano ballad about the end of her marriage. And, letting loose after a majestic and accusatory bridge, she pushes her voice way past the elegant restraint that is her signature, as it curdles into squalls and ragged screams. “To Be Loved” feels beyond what we know an Adele song to be, because the desperation is beyond what she has ever known.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_38,2021,Slay3r,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Of all the rock bands Playboi Carti could have bragged that he “could’ve joined,” it makes sense that he chose Slayer. Many of the rapper’s obsessions are reflected in the larger-than-life thrash metal group: leather-clad showmanship, a wicked mix of catchiness and confrontation, satanism at arena-scale. Ironically, “Slay3r” sounds downright bubbly next to the post-Yeezusdarkwave found elsewhere onWhole Lotta Red. But Carti’s vocals, which alternate between a stage whisper and a squeaky rasp, lend the ascending synths and distant chirps a slippery, even sinister, edge. If attitude is what matters, Carti is ready for his audition.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_37,2021,Road of the Lonely Ones,Zach Schonfeld,"“Road of the Lonely Ones” is the plaintive heart of Madlib’sSound Ancestors,spare enough to stand out from the heady rush of the rest of the album. It resurrects a mournful hook from the obscure late-1960s Philly soul group the Ethics, brightening their lost-love lament with a skittering drum break. If the task of the crate-digging producer is to convey to listeners the thrill of discovery, Madlib goes further, imbuing his dusty sample with layers of grief unanticipated by the original singer, or perhaps even the producer himself. The track’s hazy melancholy plays eerily like a tribute to MF DOOM, though Madlib created it before he learned of his friend and collaborator's untimely death.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_36,2021,Dark Gethsemane,Madison Bloom,"The beloved and enigmatic Burial resurfaced this year withShock Power of Love, his split EP with London producer Blackdown. Of its four songs, the undeniable highlight is “Dark Gethsemane,” a cinematically sprawling track clocking in at 10 minutes. Burial opens with a subtle, searching garage beat, beneath which snakes a stream of sirens, chimes, and police radio chatter. The constant vinyl crackle has a lulling quality; not so the fiery gospel cry that follows: “We must shock this nation with the power of love!” Those words loop over an incandescent choir until Burial pitches the phrase down to a darker register. Armed with bellowing horns and driving bass, the incessant sermon becomes something fiercer: a battle cry.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_35,2021,Kiss Me More,NM Mashurov,"“Kiss Me More” is an ode to one of romance’s greatest and simplest pleasures: kissing. This might seem a little PG-13 compared to the summer of “WAP,” but it’s far from chaste. There’s just something about a really heady kiss (or hundreds of them). And though it’s their first collaboration, Doja Cat and SZA have effortless chemistry. Their bestie energy alongside a playful melody reminiscent of Janet Jackson’s “The Pleasure Principle” and Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical,” capped with a deliciously bratty hook, made “Kiss Me More” one of this summer’s funnest pop songs.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_34,2021,Crystal Ball,Brandon Callender,"The sampled horn that opens “Crystal Ball” brings to mind the euphoria of a Sunday morning free of all responsibility. Though MIKE’s music has often been marked by heaviness—his 2020 albumWeight of the Worldfound him grappling with his mother’s death—this single from the NYC rapper’s luminousDisco!radiates with hope. “Suppressive of a big smile, why I had to shave clean,” he proudly raps. Even though paranoia follows closely in the song’s refrain, MIKE’s cheerful words freely drift between a smoky vocal chop and slow-churning drums. Nothing can stop his glow now.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_33,2021,Afrique Victime,Brian Howe,"Those of us who speak neither French nor Tamasheq can only experience “Afrique Victime” at a remove, yet it’s a conversation we recognize all too well. Mdou Moctar, who has carried a nomadic Tuareg tradition of electric blues called assouf  thousands of miles beyond the Sahara, inflames colonial and ancestral tongues with his spark-spitting guitar, lighting an African lament he sings so lovingly that a love song is all it could be. Above all, the iconoclast from Niger makes an aged form feel young again—not just assouf, but also rock music itself, which sounds newly radical in his hands.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_32,2021,Open Eyes,Chris O’Connell,"On “Open Eyes,” duendita sings about overcoming personal tumult, her voice trilling high and swaying low, deftly maneuvering through a jazz ensemble and the swirl of synthesizers. The New York artist’s final lines are imbued with a sense of purpose and serenity—“I’m wishing peace and stillness unto you”—but there’s a twist ending; at the coda, the already-loose structure unfurls completely, and a phrase from earlier in the song (“blind is our faith”) gets caught in a loop. duendita seems to be reminding us that the path to enlightenment is never linear, never easy, and never over.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_31,2021,Please,Alfred Soto,"A sequencer, a vocal melody with hints of KC and the Sunshine Band, and the thumpiest of thumps—it shouldn’t be this easy to make a banger. This postscript to last year’sWhat’s Your Pleasure?continues the transformation of Jessie Ware from an artist who sighed elegantly at the end of relationships into a queen of the dancefloor. A line like “Don’t upset the rhythm tonight” might have appeared as a plea on one ofDevotion’s devastating ballads; in “Please,” it’s a giddy come-on after a couple vodka sodas. Her voice wraps around the chorus like a feather boa.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_30,2021,Rainforest,Ivie Ani,"“Rainforest” is equal parts Twitter timeline cleanse and reality check. Rapper and radical thought leader Noname condemns the worship of billionaires, the emptiness of consumer culture, and rampant environmental decay, but the song isn’t a biting anthem as much as a solemn lament. Over featherlight syncopations and acoustic guitar plucks, she sounds disappointed but resolute as she lays out how racism and capitalism poison the way we feel and love. “I just wanna dance tonight,” she raps in the hook, knowing it can never be so simple.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_29,2021,Scratchcard Lanyard,Ben Cardew,"Like a high school reunion in the midst of a personal crisis, “Scratchcard Lanyard” was both oddly welcoming and creepingly surreal. The song—a tonal burst of post-punk guitars, basslines you could hang your coat on, and lyrics about ceramic shoes and bouncy balls that resonated almost despite themselves—felt like an anthem for a world knocked slightly askew.

2021_28,2021,Fuck Him All Night,Mina Tavakoli,"Like the bimbo, the bitch is a classic archetype. Half self-styled genius, half-warrior, the bitch feeds cannilly on the tender meat of respectability politics, refuses to accept an L, and embraces hostility on a level so fundamental it might be cellular. Banks is a bitch with stamina. “Fuck Him All Night” is her and producer Galcher Lustwerk’s spare take on booty house: a horny, repetitive, Chicago-indebted genre of dance music that pickles her spirit like it’s in a vat of vinegar. It’s neither her best track nor her worst, but the vim is—as promised—carnivorous, dramatic, stabby. The single’s cover has her nails splayed across her crotch in denim, spelling out the name of a fading rival (K-A-N-Y-E, right hand; ★-W-E-S-T, left) against lacquer the color of a perfect bruise.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_27,2021,Kriminel,Ross Scarano,"Over the summer, Mach-Hommy talked about his inner conflict as a member of the Haitian diaspora amid the country’s ongoing turmoil. “A lot of our psychological energy and makeup is kind of, like, split between two places because we have to be where we are,” the elusive New Jersey rappertoldNPR. “But, we also—we can’t leave where we come from.” On “Kriminel,” the heart of his 2021 albumPray for Haiti,he raps a haunting verse about the toll of everything sent home—and what home sends back. The beat loops a spectral vocal as a parade of family members visit him in his sleep. While he’s awake, another cousin reminds him to “send that fucking MoneyGram before he crack.” Toggling between Creole and English, Mach sounds ragged with worry as he details a life in constant commune with the tragedies of the past and an uncertain present.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_26,2021,Find It,Marc Hogan,"Discussion of L’Rain’s breakthrough albumFatigueoftenfocusedon the Brooklyn artist’s stated desire to be illegible and confusing. “Find It” underscores that her music can be easy to enjoy, as long as you appreciate a voyage of discovery. For much of its six-minute runtime, the song is warped, genre-mashing pop-soul not unlikeearly Ibeyi, as a scuffed pulse, murky low-end, and swirling vocals support an epigrammatic refrain: “Make a way out of no way.” The way may seem truly lost in the dizzying middle section, where cosmic jazz meets nature sounds. But all is soon found again in a field-recorded snippet of gospel song “I Won’t Complain,” which taps into a holy fervor reminiscent of Paradise Garage staple “Stand on the Word” or watchingSummer of Soulfor the first time. When the drums cascade in the end, everything makes perfect sense. It’s a sublime epiphany.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_25,2021,Jackie,Emma Madden,"On “Jackie,” the shapeshifting art-rock performer Yves Tumor ruminates on torturous love and monomaniacal obsession, singing of sleepless nights and a spoiled appetite with sincerity that turns to detachment. This hot-blooded subject matter arrives via their most familiar track to date, with brightly metallic guitars and a vocal delivery that borders on pop-punk. There’s a thrilling tension between the brooding intensity of Tumor’s lyrical concerns and the propulsive accessibility of their sonic palette. It’s hard for listeners not to become obsessed with “Jackie” too.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_24,2021,Just for Me,Stefanie Fernández,"The aughts revival got serious this year. With confessional lyrics alongside crushed-out 2-step and garage beats, 20-year-old PinkPantheress soundtracked the confessional side of TikTok in480presolution, calling back to the halcyon days of LiveJournal. “Just for me” lingers in the cutely obsessive, a diary entry that indulges the kind of vulnerability afforded by the more introverted corners of the internet.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_23,2021,Embryo,Marc Hogan,"More than a decade after emerging from the Midwest’s footwork scene, Jlin still sounds like she’s only just getting started. Across three albums between 2015 and 2018, she proved herself capable of head-spinning abstracted beats, globe-shrinking traditional instrumentation, and even a modern-dance soundtrack of ambient minimalism. On the title track from her first proper solo record in three years, Jlin once again shows the unpredictability that has been her enduring strength. It’s difficult to imagine this song, originally written for a contemporary classical group, being played by human hands; it’s an exercise in controlled chaos that reveals Jlin at her most maximalist—and audacious—yet. Beneath a buzzing synth, the hyper-rhythms of “Embryo” bounce like Aphex Twin in a corn popper and shift shapes like a life cycle with only one stage: constant metamorphosis.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_22,2021,family ties,Matthew Strauss,"“Family Ties” is IMAX rap—a multi-suite affair that opens with a horn fanfare and proceeds to cast a hungry upstart against his rejuvenated mentor, both eager to steal scenes. Its event status is heightened even further because this is the first major song to feature Kendrick Lamar in years. But first up is his cousin Baby Keem, just 20 years old at the time of the single’s release and so excitable at the start of his verse he can hardly finish his words. Keem’s elation quickly morphs into confidence as he lets off a series of playful taunts: “The girl of your dreams to me is a fan/I netted 10 million and did a lil’ dance.” Then there’s Kendrick, who tidily addresses social unrest and a pandemic in just a few lines, reminding Keem, the Pulitzer committee, and the rest of the world that he still sits patiently at the pinnacle—a taste of fury to come.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_21,2021,John L,Jazz Monroe,"black midi’s debut sprawled across the barrens of outré rock, sporadically burping up gold from its rabbit-hole hooks. The London outfit’s follow-up,Cavalcade, explores leafier, spongier territories, but only after “John L” blows open a portal from one record to the next. Propelled by a chaotically catchy riff, the album opener arms vocalist Geordie Greep with his most audacious lyrics to date: Adopting the eerie neutrality of a disaster reporter, he populates the brass-spangled maelstrom with teeming crowds and a jingoistic leader whose “gargling non-song whips throng into frenzy.” His hallucinatory imagery bursts dizzyingly to life: dark surrealism scoped on the horror of our times.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_20,2021,Good Days,Dani Blum,"SZA unspools her anxieties over a failed relationship on “Good Days,” an achingly intimate song that spills out like a stream of consciousness. Over lush, glimmering guitar, she pleads for rest, to think of anything but her former lover, for her brain to empty out. In moments of strength, she can be cutting—“I don’t miss no ex/I don’t miss no text/I choose not to respond,” she croons—and the hope in her voice transforms introspection into something stunning. She wants to believe in recovery and redemption; and in SZA’s world, the want is enough.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_19,2021,I Know I’m Funny haha,Sophie Kemp,"The stakes are low on the title track to Faye Webster’s fourth album, and that’s kind of the point. There’s no chorus, just three quick mumbled verses, about drinking saké on her front porch, the bass guitar she bought for her boyfriend’s birthday (“the same one the guy from Linkin Park plays”), an awkward encounter with his sister. Flickers of pedal steel and drums shuffle below Faye’s lyrics, as if she’s taking a drunk walk home from the bar. It’s funny, yes, but also quietly devastating in its portrayal of a young woman’s insecurities.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_18,2021,Thot Shit,Dani Blum,"The moment Megan starts rapping on “Thot Shit,” the track begins to throb. “Booked, but I squeeze a lil’ head in my calendar/Looking at the mirror like, ‘Damn, I don’t brag enough,’” she raps. With a fantastic music video designed to push back against the moral panic over last year’s “WAP,” Megan goes from relishing her sexuality to weaponizing it; when she twerks on a garbage can steamrolling a senator or spreads her legs out on his desk, it’s clear that this is combat. “Thot Shit” is a state of mind, a no-holds-barred way of approaching the world. She snatches back a flippant word used by and for women, and turns it into a battle cry.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_17,2021,I Go,Evan Minsker,"“I Go” was engineered to motivate. The Korean lyrics were pulled from a note Peggy Gou wrote to herself on her phone—some words of encouragement after seeing just how exhausted she looked in an airport bathroom mirror. Her vocals are gentle, but her promise of persistence (“I go I go, I go I go”) feels powerful. Throbbing drum machines further bolster her energizing message, turning a personal pep talk into a lull-crushing banger. A six-minute ’90s dance megamix that feels 10 minutes too short, it definitely goes.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_16,2021,Bouncin,Gio Santiago,"There’s something so pleasant and blithe about the line “I been sendin’ dirty pics/Hope they make it to the cloud,” that when Tinashe sings it, you can’t help but want the same. The333highlight delivers on the star’s unique ability to maneuver through sensual R&B with grace; her silky vocals and slick lyrics snake through the song’s beat like a gentle touch from a deft hand. She brims with confidence, assuming the role of an alluring pop icon, and projecting the kind of joy that is impossible not to join in on.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_15,2021,Little Things,Vrinda Jagota,"Where Adrianne Lenker once might have illuminated a detail like a lawn chair or a spine tattoo, “Little Things” instead recounts the things she loves about someone in terms so sweeping as to be ambiguous. In turn, Big Thief blur their edges; buzzing guitar and lyrics sung in cursive smudge together like watercolors seeping across paper. Lenker’s lyrical longing comes into sharp focus with the line “Maybe I’m a little obsessed/Maybe you do use me.” It can feel hopeless knowing someone revels in your attention without planning on giving you the same, almost like those feelings have gone to waste. But “Little Things” encourages us to embrace our yearning, to let imaginations run wild.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_14,2021,Essence,Brian Josephs,"When it first appeared onMade in Lagosin October 2020, WizKid’s “Essence” barely made a ripple, but by the following summer, the song’s melody broke through like the sun spilling from a bleak winter’s grasp. The song thrives off of the musician’s talent for slickly blending various shades of Black music, mixing Afrobeats with the sweaty R&B radio duets of the aughts. It radiates sensuality, from its beatific production to the way the track’s leading pair lustfully stretch their syllables over the instrumentals. But really, this is Tems’ showcase. When she sings her hot-blooded, “You don’t need no other body,” she wraps us all in her yearning, lovers and strangers alike.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_13,2021,La Perla,Allison Hussey,"Berlin-based producer Sofia Kourtesis built “La Perla” from field recordings she collected in Lima, Peru, as she cared for her dying father. Inspired by their shared love of the ocean, the song feels like a brief escape to a more forgiving world, surrounding a thumping, club-friendly beat with electronic layers that burble and sigh like soft waves. Kourtesis’ tender voice develops a bittersweet edge as she sings about trying to change and forget. Like the bivalve gem, “La Perla” has a soft glow, and as the opening number to Kourtesis’ gorgeousFresia MagdalenaEP, it sets the luminous tone for the songs that follow.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_12,2021,Like I Used To,Jillian Mapes,"“Like I Used To” embodies Angel Olsen’s and Sharon Van Etten’s ascensions to their thrones as two of the most important indie stars of the last dozen years—a couple of icons remembering how it’s done and taking what’s theirs. Released in May, during the brief glimmer between the vaccine’s arrival and the Delta variant’s emergence, it reflects this year’s sense of getting back to life and oneself, but also a more timeless pursuit of romantic newness. Short of Van Etten’s “Seventeen,” “Like I Used To” is the most overtly anthemic song either artist has been involved with, full of Springsteenish hooks, silvery glockenspiel runs, and a mood that is both desperately hopeful and undeniably swaggering.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_11,2021,Be Sweet,Evan Minsker,"Japanese Breakfast’s most undeniable pop song to date was originally written to be pitched to big name stars. But Michelle Zauner and collaborator Jack Tatum (of Wild Nothing) realized that they had made something too good to give up. “Be sweet to me, baby,” a beatific clustered harmony urges, pointing to that boiling point when a messy argument badly needs to simmer. It’s a song desperate for a warm blanket of trust and affection, and there’s an inescapable feeling of bliss permeating all of Zauner and Tatum’s melodic decisions. That sick slinking bassline, those atmospheric ’80s R&B guitar stabs, and Zauner’s wholehearted commitment to the kind of vocal performance and hook you’d expect from Cyndi Lauper or Stacey Q all culminate in a blast-in-your-car singalong jam. Making up takes work, but through the lens of “Be Sweet,” the payoff sounds euphoric.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_10,2021,deja vu,Jenn Pelly,"Olivia Rodrigo first broke through with the chart-conquering phenom “drivers license,” but it was on its follow-up that she truly arrived. The endlessly screamable “deja vu” is all about the brutal details we think we glean from afar, likely through screens, about people who were once the main characters of our lives. It’s a psychological pop spiral, watching an ex move on, recycling the energy and excitement they sucked from you—strawberry ice cream, “Glee,” and Billy Joel’s “Uptown Girl” have possibly never instigated such impassioned indignation. “She thinks it’s special, but it’s all reused,” Olivia sings, rightfully bitter. From the outside, their lives might look like movies. Maybe the ex-boyfriend would get a credit. But in the drama of “deja vu,” Olivia is directing.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_9,2021,Mohabbat,Sam Sodomsky,"In “Mohabbat,” the centerpiece of Arooj Aftab’s breakthrough albumVulture Prince, the Brooklyn-based, Pakistan-born composer is accompanied by harp, flugelhorn, synth, guitar, and percussion—but you could be mistaken for imagining she’s the only person in the room. The arrangement coheres into a gentle cycle of the notes of a major chord, somewhere between an ambient arpeggio and the fingerpicked intro to a folk song, the kind with endless verses. As Aftab sings about grief and sadness in her calm, dusky voice, she doesn’t just tell you the way those feelings can isolate and suspend you in time. She and her collaborators make you feel it with every note, with every breath.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_8,2021,Valentine,Quinn Moreland,"Lindsey Jordan loves hard. On “Valentine,” the young indie rocker is spiraling in the aftermath of a breakup. It’s not as if the relationship was picture-perfect: Atop a ghostly synth she describes unequal power dynamics, conflicting desires. But that insight doesn’t make the notion of her ex moving on any less devastating: In fact, the intricacies of her narrative make it all the more thrilling when Jordan erupts on the song’s chorus over thunderous guitars, imbuing every word with an aching urgency. Heartbreak is as old as time itself, but on “Valentine,” Jordan transforms the feeling into rocket fuel, blowing a kiss as she blasts off.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_7,2021,Working for the Knife,Puja Patel,"The saying goes that if you do what you love, you’ll never have to work a day in your life. Mitski would like to have a word on that. After a long and grueling world tour supporting her breakthrough albumBe the Cowboy, the singer took time off in 2019, saying she needed a break from the “constant churn” of performance. “Working for the Knife"" is her brooding, melancholic first major single back from this respite, and acts as an incisive warning about how much of our identity we give to our life’s greatest undertakings, and who we’re giving it up for. The song unfolds as a balancing act of vulnerability and expectation, of altruistic self-expression and the vanity of wanting to be seen, or even adored. There’s some humor to it all; forlorn, she recognizes that the world never stops turning, and that it’s fine to lie to ourselves if it helps pass the time. It’s a one-act play of existential malaise and a sardonic anthem for those who can't help but seek out the spotlight.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_6,2021,Lumberjack,Mehan Jayasuriya,"We’ve always known that Tyler was one of the best rappers working. And yet, for the last decade, he’s seemed to delight in withholding this ability while pursuing other opportunities: orchestral pop, cherry-colored funk,songs about the Grinch. With “Lumberjack,” he returns to hard-nosed rap, though it hardly feels like a capitulation—if anything, it sounds like he’s still thumbing his nose at naysayers. The beat pulls its trembling keys from a Gravediggaz song (probably a nod to critics that tried to pigeonhole Odd Future as “horrorcore”) and the song’s chorus (“Rolls Royce pull up/Black boy hop out”) is delivered like a middle finger. “That’s my nuance, used to be a weirdo,” he deadpans at one point, reminding us that hip-hop’s ultimate insider used to be an outsider.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_5,2021,White Dress,Jeremy D. Larson,"The pop music Lana Del Rey is making right now feels unattainable, like you simply have to cock your head and admire it through glass. Who is this person casting Sun Ra and Kings of Leon in a similar light? Who is using an Orlando business conference as a catalyst for Proustian reverie? Who is whispering these chipped-paint choruses so high in her register that they are impossible to sing along to?Who are you?is a question that has dogged Lana’s entire career, a question her songs answer mythically, cryptically, truthfully—sometimes all at once. This is what happens on “White Dress,” co-written by Jack Antonoff, a delirious highlight from her albumChemtrails Over the Country Club.Lana—a goth who wears all white in an attempt to be themostgoth—is our melodramatic tour guide through her past, our “waitress/white dress” near-homophone queen. Sure, it’s a trip down memory lane to a simpler life before all the tabloid brouhaha, but when she sings about how waiting tables “made me feel like a god,” it’s as if she’s staring into a swirling cauldron, casting a spell to deify herself once more.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_4,2021,Pick Up Your Feelings,Eric Torres,"Breakup songs tend to fall into one of two categories. The first include ones that luxuriate in the aftermath of a relationship, reminiscing on what was lost and finding something like solace on the other side. Then there are those from the perspective of the jilted partner who wants to let it burn, pour a drink, and dance on the ashes. Jazmine Sullivan’s smoldering “Pick Up Your Feelings” belongs firmly with the latter. Here, whoever messed things up picked the right one on the wrong day. “You’re off the lease/Run me my keys,” Sullivan demands in the opening verse, voice pirouetting through octaves. The song rightfully claims a spot in the pantheon of definitive R&B dismissals like “Tyrone” and “Irreplaceable,” where specificity (“Need a ride?/Call that bitch/Gas way too expensive”) creates a vividly relatable portrait. If you need a sign to dump the two-timing partner in your life, Sullivan is graciously here to deliver.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_3,2021,Days Like These,Anna Gaca,"“Days Like These” is a song in the form of an eclipse: the first half made of blinding light, the second an uncanny, disembodied stillness. Singing into a static blur that sounds like wind noise on video, or like someone’s sawing through the tape, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker describe a vast and subtle longing, a desire for a kind of transcendence not found on Earth. “Know that I would do anything,” they cry, their fried-out vocals taking on the call-and-response pattern of a hymn. But in this strange, desaturated grief, there’s no action to take. Even the song doesn’t end, really; it just stretches out, twinkling in the distance, a lone satellite pressing on toward the edge of space.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_2,2021,Hard Drive,Ryan Dombal,"“Hard Drive” is part self-help podcast, part hero’s quest, part breathing exercise. Some of the song is spoken plain like a story, some of it sung. People pass through, including a security guard and a driving instructor, all with grounding lessons to impart. Its instrumentation is dotted with wandering saxophone and guitar tones as dewy as a fall morning. The combined effect is curiously invigorating, like a perfume with an underlying note of dill pickle. As the centerpiece of New York City songwriter Cassandra Jenkins’ albumAn Overview on Phenomenal Nature, “Hard Drive” is also a kind of mission statement. Her search for guidance to quell neuroses both philosophical and practical eventually leads her to a psychic, who advises her to close her eyes, breathe in deeply, and count to three. As Jenkins repeats the numbers like a mantra, the song’s drum beat stiffens its spine and the sax starts to really blow. By the end, we’re floating, if only for a moment.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2021_1,2021,Bunny Is a Rider,Cat Zhang,"Who is Bunny? In Caroline Polachek’s vision, she is a figure of undeniable intrigue. Sexy and beguiling, untraceable even by satellite, she goes where she wants and is beholden to no one. You wish you were Bunny; we all do. Casting off the gossamer avant-pop of 2019’sPang,Polachek and producer Danny L Harle opt for a sound that is both commercial and weird: a deep, juicy bassline befitting of the Top 40, a “yoo hoo” whistle, a sample taken from Harle’s giggling baby, even marimba plinks that conjure an island vacation with Kygo. It’s a characteristic display of PC Music alum Harle’simpulseto simultaneously send-up and pay homage to popular forms, with results too deliciously crisp to read as a joke. Meanwhile, as if recreating the slipperiness of Bunny, Polachek darts through various images (blazing fireworks, a wet palette, a cut check), never resting long enough for you to grasp what’s next. She enters a new dimension in the chorus, switching from narrator to first-person, trading a Drake-like rhythmic delivery for her usual lithe, crystalline singing. She may be channeling the want to be immaterial, the ability to evaporate like a wisp of smoke, but when she sings“I’m so nonphysical,”it comes with embodied longing, as if she’s aching for touch. The thrill of the song is wrapped up in how it skirts any pressure to lay out its intentions, how it moves at its own whims. Bunny keeps you guessing.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2021,Pitchfork
2022_100,2022,As It Was,Amy Phillips,"“As It Was” is the kind of twinkly little confection that would easily get the indie kids pogoing at any local DIY dance night at any point in the last two decades. It just happens to have been recorded by one of the biggest pop stars in the world in 2022 instead of, say, the Strokes twenty years earlier. “You know it’s not the same as it was,” Harry Styles sighs, giving a nod to the easy bait of nostalgia. A pointillist synth line tap dances through the song, and all over that nagging pandemic-era malaise we’re all desperately trying to shake. Resistance is futile.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_99,2022,Welcome to Hell,Evan Rytlewski,"Many songs have contended that war is hell; few have ever depicted that hell as crazed as this. Black Midi’s “Welcome to Hell” is four minutes of disorientation, a trillion-BPM assault on the senses that plays likeSaving Private Ryan’s Normandy scene as a fast-forwarded Bugs Bunny cartoon. Somewhere amid all the Les Claypool riffage and incalculable time signatures, the band squeezes in a bizzaro homage to Shirley Bassey’s James Bond themes. The ridiculousness of the pastiche doesn’t dull its intensity one bit.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_98,2022,Tonight,Rob Arcand,"More than 25 years into their career, Phoenix are still finding new ways to sound brilliantly, effortlessly cool. Case in point: “Tonight,” a smooth collaboration with Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig. Drunk on the promise of a great night out, frontman Thomas Mars charms his way through dinner and the course of an entire relationship in the span of one magical encounter. A sobering, early-morning apology inspires a fleeting moment of self-reflection as the vocalists pause, muse existentially about their endless partying, and ultimately resolve to do it all again, just one verse later. It’s an endearing defense of the pleasure principle from two guys who have seen their share of debauchery—but goddamn if it doesn’t sound fun.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_97,2022,happy accident,Carrie Courogen,"Tomberlin got to know her new home of New Yorkby walking it. “happy accident,” from her sophomore albumI Don’t Know Who Needs to Hear This…,unravels like an aimless meander through the city with unruly thoughts spiraling out along the path. Set to Cass McCombs’ elliptical guitar loop and thumps of percussion that land like leaden footsteps, the singer-songwriter interrogates a relationship that has been ambiguous for too long, her voice seething and weary. A relationship, just like a walk, isn’t always in need of a destination, and “happy accident” lingers brutally in the uncertainty of what might come next.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_96,2022,Pájaros en Verano,Arjun Srivatsa,"What’s there to be grateful for in a hopeless world? According to Ela Minus, clouds, crickets, and sleep, to name a few. “Pájaros en Verano” is an ode to the quotidian pleasures we often ignore. Her praise for the small stuff pairs perfectly with DJ Python’s bubbly production, led by a bright, sweet mallet-like synth that meanders through minimal percussion. It’s a subtle anthem that invites you to slow down and linger on life’s simple delights.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_95,2022,May Brigade,Vanessa Ague,"Horse Lords has spent the past 12 years on a quest for utopia, seeking freedom and euphoria within the structures of their experimental rock music. On “May Brigade,” a clashing, raucous pattern born out of microtonal crunch and minimalist repetition morphs into free jazz freneticism, and distant saxophone trills get swallowed by drones and shimmering static. The song’s effortless abandon shows us the bliss that lies beneath Horse Lords’ heady ideas; within its sharp twists and turns there lies a motivating joy—a reminder to always keep on keeping on.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_94,2022,Lydia Wears a Cross,Sophie Kemp,"“Lydia Wears a Cross” is like driving rain, slapping you in the face, reminding you that you are both awake and alive. Julia Jacklin sings about religion and what it’s like to be a girl, sitting in the pews, whispering holy words without knowing what any of it means. She prays for Princess Diana; she listens to theJesus Christ Superstarsoundtrack. “I’d be a believer,” she sings, “If it was all just song and dance.” Around her, a fuzzed-out guitar crashes into a kick drum. It’s a look back at childhood, where real sorrow and brutal honesty outweigh nostalgia.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_93,2022,Punish,Zhenzhen Yu,"“Punish” explores nihilistic self-loathing through a multi-genre electronic fantasia. The Saitama-based hyperpop artist 4s4ki alternates between clear and Auto-Tuned singing across the song’s quickly shifting sonics, which incorporate sounds from digicore and Japanese hip-hop. Her scream of the titular “punish!” flashes like a brief, electric glitch against the serrated drum‘n’bass chorus—a cry for help enmeshed in a suffocating, cybernetic pop landscape.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_92,2022,Bull Believer,Margeaux Labat,"Wednesday’s “Bull Believer” is a two-act grunge odyssey in which lead vocalist Karly Hartzman jumps from chronicling Spanish bullfighting to describing being ignored by the guy she loves at a party. The dizzying song alternates between abrasion and solace, cranking back up just as it reaches a point of melancholic calm; monstrously heavy guitars and lap steel squelch beneath Hartzman’s guttural screams. As her paramour is distracted playing Mortal Kombat, she echoes the video game’s calls to “finish him!,” crying torturously before coming back for one final whisper—a satisfying end to an emotional nine-minute-long journey.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork

The opening tremolo of “Pods” flies like a shuttle over a laser-weaving loom, and its 15-second breakdown feels more like being in a video game than any point ofReady Player One. There’s a Sunset Strip guitar solo with baroque overtones; an opera-cloaked organ tone is stuffed with hyphy vocals and capped with an EDM riser. Too good to be untrue, Two Shell filigree the line between mystery and mischief. They’ll probably turn out to be AI.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_90,2022,bezhigo,Joshua Minsoo Kim,"Joe Rainey’s music attests to the importance of community. A member of the Red Lake Nation of Ojibwe people, Rainey knows the value of surrounding yourself with others who inspire you, and this belief underlines every track on his debutNiineta, a deep collaboration with producer Andrew Broder that remembers loved ones who’ve passed and samples decades’ worth of pow wow recordings. Standout “bezhigo” weaves together three separate recordings of Indigenous vocalizing, and as the string arrangements surge, a steady beat arrives in the form of industrial clang, sounding like the repeated strikes of a blacksmith’s hammer. There’s beauty, “bezhigo” suggests, in forging one’s identity, purpose, and dreams alongside those who share your vision.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_89,2022,Diet Coke,Dean Van Nguyen,"You gotta hand it to Pusha T—it takes dedication to still strive toward drug-rap perfection 20 years after making a song as good as “Grindin.” On “Diet Coke,” he raps over an 88-Keys beat that’sold enoughto be called up for jury duty—all vacuum-packed drums and scratched-in vocal samples—but King Push has always made his music outside of linear time, peddling rhymes as eternal as the drug trade itself. “Master recipes under stove lights” he explains on the hook, ostensibly a reference to crack, but he could also be talking about how he manages to pull off this one kind of track again and again.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_88,2022,Edge of the Edge,Shy Thompson,"Panda Bear and Sonic Boom began their joint albumResetwith a simple premise: take the opening moments from great songs of the 1950s and ’60s, loop them, and shape their compositions out from there. “Edge of the Edge” uses Randy & the Rainbows’ “Denise” as its melodic germ, augmenting the 1963 doo-wop hit’s sweet and simple melody with sleigh bells, hand claps, and Panda Bear’s bittersweet croon before beaming in transmissions of dial tones and modem sounds from a less distant past. It’s an infectiously catchy tune that transcends time as it embodies these trusted collaborators’ experimental spirit.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_87,2022,What I Want,Peyton Thomas,"Not since Jonathan Richman’s “I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar” has a pop song so perfectly captured the bubbly joy of taking sips, shaking hips, and regarding leather dykes with love. But “What I Want” is about self-love too. MUNA singer Katie Gavin doesn’t want to just date a girl, she wants a girl towantto date her. The song hits hard on a dancefloor and even harder in a graffiti-spattered bathroom; face the mirror, freshen your lipstick, and mouth the hook: “There’s nothing wrong with what I want.”",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_86,2022,Strange Neighbourhood,Simon Reynolds,"You could say that “Strange Neighbourhood” and the almost-album it comes from,Antidawn, are formulaic—but it’s a formula Burial patented. Heownsthis sound: the shivery shards of imploring vocals that flare up like embers aloft on the wind, the funeral-parlor organ swells, the moist reverberance and muffled found sounds, the disconcerting pauses and glitchy lapses where it feels like the track is giving up the ghost. Rather than seeming like déjà vu, this 11-minute audio-movie evocation of the hauntedness of urban space feels as fresh and original as the first time you heard Burial. You start to think he could carry on like this forever.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_85,2022,Ascension,Paul A. Thompson,"In the first verse of “Ascension,” Ka describes his style as “measured efficiency.” Indeed, the veteran rapper and producer has cut away all excess from his music, be it programmed drums or nonessential syllables and details. And on this highlight fromLanguish Arts, one of two albums he dropped in September, the Brownsville, Brooklyn native pries into his childhood—a topic that has grown more central to his writing in recent years—to explain why he believes this cool remove is not only an aesthetic choice but a moral good. Sampled reminiscences about family bookend the song, while Ka bounces, as ever, between the material and metaphysical, the days “long as the solstice” and the uncles’ lives cut short.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_84,2022,Anything,Stephen Thomas Erlewine,"“Anything” is about an undefined anxiety so persistent, it numbs everything else, and keeps you up until dawn. At first, Sharon Van Etten’s admission of ambivalence in the face of war and climate collapse—“I didn’t feel anything”—seems like a self-soothing mantra. But this booming standout from her albumWe’ve Been Going About This All Wrongpivots at the bridge, when her lover comforts her, providing a moment of connection that nudges her away from the emptiness. As the song builds from spare, haunted strums to a surging crescendo, Van Etten’s tone flips, and by the end she’s belting out her unfeeling thoughts with palpable desperation.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_83,2022,City in a City,Sam Goldner,"Normally, Oakland saxophonist Cole Pulice uses live-signal processing to stretch their loosely winding jazz into sinuous, squishy shapes. But “City in a City,” the centerpiece of their wonderfully amorphous albumScry, features no such electronic manipulation. The song glides around two tumbling piano chords, as Pulice lets their unadorned saxophone lead the way, dancing up and down its range with autumnal grace. As transporting as Pulice’s more overtly experimental work can be, they’ve never made anything quite so simple and stunning.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_82,2022,Real Hips,Joshua Minsoo Kim,"Bandmanrill never wastes a good sample. On “Real Hips” the kinetic Newark rapper comes through with the zeal of a personal trainer, transforming aJersey club classicinto a HIIT workout aimed at your abductors. DJ Bake and KilSoSouth ensure the beat is both vigorous and elastic—the right balance for Bandmanrill to rifle through talk of parents, success, and paranoia. He always comes back to that instructional, hands-on-hips hook, though, because this is a reminder that, for how frenzied life can be, having a good time should reign supreme.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_81,2022,Royal and Desire,Jeremy D. Larson,"Animal Collective have done all the woodsy jamborees and primeval oozing and childlike explorations one could ever ask for, but “Royal and Desire” is above allbeautiful—hardly one of the first words used to describe most Animal Collective songs. Deakin takes a commanding lead on the closer ofTime Skiffs, their best album in more than a decade, with the rest of the band rising behind him in gaseous harmony. The music is sweet and legato, the sound is psychedelic rock falling from a soft-serve machine. This is AnCo at their most imperial, slowly stepping down the aisle, climbing atop the dais, and solemnly placing a lava lamp on the altar.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_80,2022,Washed Away,Jessica Kariisa,"Over the course of three fully realized projects in the mid-2010s, Kelela wove together R&B’s tenderness with the ruggedness of club music, showing us that in allowing pain and pleasure to coexist, we might succeed in forging a path from the former to the latter. And then she disappeared. “Washed Away,” her first new song in five years, explores the aftermath of reconciliation and the eternal question of what happens next. While some might succumb to neurosis and anguish, Kelela chooses peaceful meditation. Devoid of both kick drums and confessional lyrics, the ambient track embraces the vast unknown of the future with a grace akin to ocean mist landing gently on bare skin.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_79,2022,Backwash,Ian Cohen,"Gilla Band wisely recognize that nearly all of the best ideas about how guitar bands can move on from punk come from hip-hop and electronic music. “Backwash” is the Irish band’s culminating proof-of-concept: As abrasive as it is propulsive, as direct as it is diffuse, the song runs post-punk’s basics through production tricks you can learn from modern-rap masterpieces like Playboi Carti’sWhole Lotta Redor Earl Sweatshirt’sSome Rap Songs.The guitars are subjected to blown-out digital processing with no regard for how the sound might be replicated onstage; lyrics about the horror of binge-watchingBig Brothercumulate into a deluge of consciousness. Even the title is an inversion of punk-rock cliché: “Backwash” isn’t an image of spitting into someone’s face, but choking on your own disgust.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_78,2022,hear you,Nadine Smith,"Yung Kayo’s glitchy warble makes for a natural fit within Young Thug’s YSL roster, but the Washington, D.C. native’s music feels closer in spirit to the glittery rave-pop of Drain Gang than to Atlanta trap. On “hear you,” Kayo leaves the material realm, ascending to a dimension of pure light and sound. The presence of Queens-based experimentalist Eartheater might seem leftfield for an album that also features Gunna and Yeat, but her almost-inhuman vocal range makes for a symbiotic duet with Kayo’s unpredictable crooning.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_77,2022,Back to the Radio,Mehan Jayasuriya,"“Back to the Radio,” the momentous opener that sets the table for Porridge Radio’s third album of vein-bulging post-punk, is essentially one big crescendo. Spartan melodies cut through drums that jitter with nervous energy, as the British band approximates the feeling of walls closing in. Meanwhile, frontwoman Dana Margolin fills in the scenes of a hollow relationship: a house on lockdown, mutters in a slow-moving car. Porridge Radio render this quotidian prison so evocatively, it’s hard to not want to stay a while.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_76,2022,Cada Músculo,Grayson Haver Currin,"At first, “Cada Músculo” is a thicket of riddles and warnings—a brawny cello rises and lunges, a sibilant violin snarls and lashes, an inquisitive synth taunts and vanishes. This is how the Mexico City-based composer and singer Mabe Fratti renders our vexing world. Her voice glides through the mess, disarming it through self-sovereignty: “Cada músculo tiene una voz,” or “Every muscle has a voice.” Those rough sounds soften when she opens her mouth, sorted into something like breezy chamber pop, the mysteries of this moment temporarily banished. The end’s howling strings are a stark reminder of the iterative effort that existence demands.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_75,2022,Tabula Rasa,Paul A. Thompson,"After a pair oflaconicrecordswhose goal seemed, at times, to obfuscate, Earl Sweatshirt returned this year withSICK!, an album dominated by songs that cut through the noise. Its centerpiece is “Tabula Rasa,” a patient piano number that pairs him with the unvarnished New York duo Armand Hammer. While Elucid and billy woods rap—vividly—about human connections made, broken, and fraying, Earl details the way a similar disintegration forced him to remake himself. “This game of telephone massive,” he raps during his loping verse. “I do what I have to with the fragments.”",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_74,2022,Protection From Evil,Judy Berman,"Like a fog machine dosed with sage oil, the opening track of Ibibio Sound Machine’sElectricitybrings a heady rush to the disco. Over a cauldron of stomp and shimmer, British-Nigerian frontwoman Eno Williams repeats her incantation: “Spiritual/Invisible/Protection/From evil.” Produced by Hot Chip, the song hovers at the crossroads of Afrobeat and electronic pop, mixing horns, synths, and robotic vocalizations. Each element amplifies Williams’ impassioned chant, a benediction delivered with the haunted force of an exorcism.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_73,2022,Sincerely Face,Alphonse Pierre,"Plenty of local scenes around the country tried to recapture the magic of Michigan rap this year, but none of them boasted a one-of-a-kind character like Detroit’s own Babyface Ray. “Sincerely Face” lays out what has made Ray such a pillar: Through his icy delivery, basic rap flexes about Rolexes, courtside seats, and steakhouse dinners sound revelatory. Over a chilly beat, he shrugs his way through a mix of life lessons with inimitable cool. It’s the type of song where the fly aura rubs off on you every time you play it. They only make ’em like this in Michigan.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_72,2022,B.O.T.A. (Baddest of Them All),Gabriel Szatan,"Taking inspiration from animmaculate posterfor the 1973 Pam Grier blaxploitation filmCoffy, every flirty bar and bubbly riff of “B.O.T.A.” oozes cool. Sassy organ house has long lit up British dancefloors, buttopping the chartswas hardly a forgone conclusion for underground UK Garage producer-DJs Eliza Rose and Interplanetary Criminal. After meeting the accelerant of TikTok, though, the tune’s explosion felt inevitable; it began festival season as a limited pressing and ended it as the hottest record in the UK and Ireland. In a year that resurfaced important debates about the ownership and authenticity of dance music, two things about “B.O.T.A.” ring true: It belongs to the people, and it’s real as fuck.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_71,2022,Coochie (a bedtime story),Margeaux Labat,"“Coochie (a bedtime story)” is the sweetest X-rated lullaby imaginable. Shygirl starts things off on a direct line with, well, pussy, sounding like she’s cooing into an old Nokia phone: “Hello? Is anyone there? It’s the coochie calling.” What follows is a soft, funny testament to the UK artist’s unapologetic sexuality, its liquid beat gliding, stuttering, and zipping under her airy vocals. That Shygirl can proclaim her own horniness with such cuteness and levity is a coochie-attracting combination in and of itself.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_70,2022,Computer Exploder,Pete Tosiello,"Like a drunk staggering across the beach, “Computer Exploder” lurches toward its chorus in fits and starts. The sunny skies of the opening verse are soon clouded with references to heartbreak and addiction, collapsing in a screeching rush. The hook, when it finally arrives, flashes Oso Oso’s signature blend of surf-rock guitars and emo harmonies, the love and drugs complicated by frontman Jade Lilitri’s self-referential songwriting. “When nothing goes quite like you planned it/Write 12 songs, swing like you can’t miss,” he sings in a nod tohis latest album’s tracklist. The go-for-broke candor captures Lilitri’s ambition, casting him as a heavy-hitting rocker in an era that’s all but dispensed with them.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_69,2022,Baking Soda,Jayson Greene,"On the sun-kissed “Baking Soda,” producers Monte Booker and Amarah break down the beat so radically that its melodic tendons barely attach to the rhythmic spine—when Mavi murmurs, “I been gave my soul away to the drum, I’mma live forever” on the chorus, the drum itself feels a hair’s breadth away from oblivion. It’s a complementary backdrop for the heady North Carolina rapper’s elusive insights; what does it mean, exactly, when he says, “And your tears is now trees”? The meaning blooms in the line’s lovely, lingering after-image, as the beat crumbles and rebuilds itself like the last dregs of a dream.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_68,2022,Bad Love,Jesse Locke,"Dehd’s Emily Kempf is howling with her chest, sprinting at top speed towards a new dawn. The beatific “Bad Love” is more than a boldmea culpafor hurting people in the past, it’s a rapturous embrace of the dangerous task of loving again. Kempf stutters syllables in her quest for “re-re-redemption,” her hopscotching vocal rhythms echoed by machine-gun bursts of snare and sparse guitar licks. With the wind in her sails, her roars swell in size, pushing past the timidity of heartbreak to arrive at one of the most invigorating indie rock anthems of the year.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_67,2022,Pull Up,Isabelia Herrera,"Koffee boasts about her new luxury lifestyle on “Pull Up,” but it’s never arrogant or sanctimonious. Over an aquatic beat from British-Ghanaian producer Jae5, the Jamaican singer’s orotund voice feels celebratory, a match for a track that bridges the sunny textures of dancehall and Afrobeats. If anyone else leaned out of the window of a drifting car and sang about pulling up to the party in an Audi, it’d probably feel boring and out-of-touch. But when Koffee does just that in the video, her mouth full of braces, you can’t help but grin along with her.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_66,2022,Right to Riot,Daniel Felsenthal,"The most immediate cut on British-Armenian producer Hagop Tchaparian’s startling debut albumBolts, “Right to Riot” merges worlds. Droning zurna melodies and tumbling dhol drums vie clamorously for our attention, but Tchaparian’s mastery of more traditional tactics—rising bass, cleansing releases, and a sample looped to sound like an alarm—make the track a gem of contemporary techno, whittling down the Four Tet collaborator’s sweeping vision into a sharp point.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_65,2022,Body Paint,Marc Hogan,"Although the meta space-lounge of 2018’sTranquility Base Hotel & Casinofelt like a departure, this year’sThe Carreinforced how elusive Arctic Monkeys’ debonair art-rock has always been. “Body Paint,” the album’s cinematic centerpiece, belongs in the revered UK band’s pantheon of slippery slow burners, alongside enigmatic 2000s ballads “505” and “Cornerstone.” Swapping orchestral swoon for glam-rock crunch midway through—right after Alex Turner croons, “And if you’re thinking of me/I’m probably thinking of you”—the song is an emotive puzzle, obsessed with artifice and lingering smudges you can’t wash away.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_64,2022,Ugly Season,Owen Myers,"On the LGBTQ+ anthem “Queen,” Mike Hadreas embraced the power in being viewed by homophobes as a “sea witch with penis tentacles.” Eight years later, over the skeletal reggae beat of “Ugly Season,” his exploration of queerness veers further left: He is a heathen outcast finding abject pleasure and autoerotic arousal in filth, rot, and hearty handfuls of Vaseline. Hadreas’ voice is high and pure amid guttural screams and mammalian lurches, offering hymnic bon mots that could have been written by Jean Genet: “Split, black, pit.” This year, asqueerartistspowerfully embraced monstrousness-as-dissent, “Ugly Season” burrows into outsider living to emerge as a swamp creature with carnal allure and a tender caress.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_63,2022,New Bottega,Mina Tavakoli,"Azealia Banks considers the difference between fashion (what you wear) and style (what you possess) on “New Bottega,” which is to say, she is aware of how much she lays claim to. Some of the biggest albums this year drew on club sounds like a strategy, but the Harlem-bred Banks has always made a home inside house music. As she lists the names of designers she likes and doesn’t like in a bad Italian accent, “New Bottega” enters into the Banksian capsule collection—a staple in a malcontent designer’s oeuvre.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_62,2022,What They Call Us,Katherine St. Asaph,"This is the sound of crisis approaching from all sides: the escalating cruelties against its subjects (“did you hear what they call us?”) and the indifference of those watching it happen (“can you fix it, can youcare?”). In a desperate plea for mercy, Karin Dreijer sings as if they’re grinding their teeth down to the nerve; the track shudders and startles at every turn, desolate synths circling the arrangement like vultures above wasteland. Despite this, “What They Call Us” is not the sound of defeat. It’s a defiant snarl in the face of circumstance: “I will stay if Idare.”",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_61,2022,What It Is,Brandon Callender,"Uncertainty can gnaw at your psyche, boxing out every other thought. But Amber Mark imbues the troubling feeling with celestial wonder on “What It Is,” looking to a higher power to answer her questions following a failed love. The neat and simmering groove moves in lockstep underneath the R&B singer’s vocals, which mix her patient tone with agile vocal runs and gasping harmonies. Adrift in a stream of milky synths, she shows how powerful it is to be lost.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_60,2022,Problem With It,Jeremy Gordon,"The charm of Katie Crutchfield and Jess Williamson’s album is how they seamlessly combine their simpatico strengths—the plainspoken emotiveness, the pretty melodies, the diaristic attention to experiences big and small—into easy-breezy country-pop that wouldn’t sound out of place on Nashville radio. “Problem With It” is the shining jewel from their debut LP as Plains, an airy travelogue of deep feelings about wanderlust and wack lovers that glides by like a fast car on an empty interstate. And the harmonies! There’s true joy in their vocal communion, most striking when the instruments drop out and it’s just the two of them singing, finding their peace and place in the world within each other’s presence.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_59,2022,Don’t Forget You’re Precious,Allison Hussey,"The Mancunian saxophonist and spoken-word artist Alabaster DePlume meanders through the stuff stuck in his mind: an ex’s email address, a train transfer, assorted strings of identifying digits. Despite these thoughts—or even deeper, more abstracted aches—he delivers a serene reminder of what matters most. “They can’t use us on one another if we don’t forget we’re precious,” he offers. Against airy background vocals and fluttering strings, DePlume’s comforting reassurance feels like a secular blessing, a private rallying point away from life’s greedy clamor.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_58,2022,melt,Hannah Jocelyn,"Kehlani’s desire for intimacy is insatiable, even as they tangle with their lover in bed. Over Happy Perez and Pop Wansel’s blissful backbeat, Kehlani meticulously and melismatically details a fantasy where they share a physical form with their partner, with only Kehlani’s tattoos differentiating them. In an era flush withsapphic love songs,“melt” stands out for both its grandiose string arrangement and its specificity, finding the most happiness in quiet moments.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_57,2022,Running With the Hurricane,Laura Snapes,"Fiona Applespread like strawberries and climbed like peas and beans; Camp Cope run with the hurricane, setting aside the heavy balloon of depression and obsessive self-loathing to keep pace with the forces that might otherwise knock them flat. There’s some Springsteen-y heroism in their full-pelt charge towards daylight—“Look out boys/I’m on fire and I’m not going out,” Georgia Maq announces—but the Australian trio is mostly guided by their country-punk foremothers: the Chicks, Lucinda Williams, Gillian Welch, Neko Case. The song rattles along in a lovely cacophony of jangling piano, lunging bass, and a baton-swap of choruses, like some junker with sturdy suspension and everything else nailed down just barely enough to make your escape.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_56,2022,Break My Soul,Sasha Geffen,"“Break My Soul” demands its listeners leave all psychic weight at the door. “Release the stress!” a Big Freedia sample commands inside an Earth-shaking house pulse, as Beyoncé presides over the dancefloorlike she just rode in on the back of a hologram horse. Bey gives a fully embodied performance that invites the rest of us to luxuriate inside our own bodies—to spit out the toxins and savor the pleasure that floods in once they’re gone. Unleashed at the height of summer, “Break My Soul” ushered in a sorely needed season of abandon and relief, serving as balm and catalyst at the same time.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_55,2022,Basketball Shoes,Hannah Seidlitz,"It’s impossible to know precisely how many songs have been written about Charli XCX wet dreams, but you could reasonably assume only one is a 12-minute chamber-rock requiem whose reference to Concord Air Jordans bore a concept record about the Concorde jet disaster. “Basketball Shoes” erupts with the essentials of Black Country, New Road: frenetic tempo changes, bright arpeggiation, violin, saxophone, glockenspiel, distortion, screaming, doorbell chimes. Concluding more than their albumAnts From Up There, the finale bids adieu to singer Isaac Wood, who left the band days before its release.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_54,2022,Angel,Shawn Reynaldo,"Reggaeton always seems to figure into discussions of DJ Python’s music—the New York-based producer did previously coin the term “deep reggaeton” to describe his sound—but while “Angel,” the lead track from hisClub Sentimientos Vol. 2EP, is built atop a loosely Caribbean shuffle, the sprawling tune is better suited to an afternoon of lounging by the pool than a sweaty night of perreo. Gliding across nearly 11 minutes of plush textures and dreamily plinking tones, the song has a hypnotic, almost womb-like allure, its patient pulse exuding a luxurious (but never ostentatious) sense of cool.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_53,2022,honda,Aimee Cliff,"Where FKA twigs’ 2019 albumMAGDALENEpeeled back the skin of a visceral pain, her 2022 mixtapeCAPRISONGSrediscovered a sense of somatic joy. twigs leans all the way into that physicality on “honda,” a dubby duet with the English artist Pa Salieu. Over a bone-deep bassline, Salieu and twigs’ voices twist around one another, mirroring the tangled, dancing limbs they sing about. At first listen, “honda” is all sensual chemistry, felt across a dancefloor, or speeding down the highway. But Salieu’s breezy monologue about looking at himself in the mirror frames the song in a different light: It’s also about those moments you feel entirely in your own body, reclaiming your “one-of-a-kind” self.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_52,2022,Jackie Down the Line,Will Hermes,"The lead single from Fontaines D.C.’sSkinty Fiais seductively dark, with a menacing bassline, gnarly ’90s post-punk guitar skeins, and a lyric that masquerades as a toxic-boyfriend confession. Like much of the album, “Jackie Down the Line” reveals itself with unpacking as ameditation on Irish identity: in this case, an examination of the way that cultural marginalization can breed self-hate and self-fulfilling prophecy. Grian Chatten’s Dublin brogue, flecked with the soulful British surliness of Mark E. Smith and Noel Gallagher, complicated things further. So did the song’s video premiere, brilliantly stagedfor the Tonight Showin a deserted theater for a roving camera that seemed unable to get a fix on the singer—much like the singer himself.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_51,2022,Looking at Your Pager,Gabriel Szatan,"Kieran Hebden’s flair for tunes that intersect credibility and popularity already put him in a lofty position, but “Looking at Your Pager” proved another beast entirely. With fangs added to 3LW’skiss-offand those signature pearlescent Four Tet chimes dashed against a pair of impudent basslines—like fine snow gracing an enormous, stinking cement mixer in mid-churn—2021’s fervently sought track ID became 2022’s great dancefloor unifier: It runs with the current UK vogue for growling mechanical steppers while offering sanctuary to nomads wandering America’s post-EDM plains in search of a new thrill. Although “Pager” gifted countless DJs a get-out-of-jail card this summer, they should be on red alert. Hebden’s ear for a monster hit is only getting stronger.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_50,2022,Belize,Brad Shoup,"MF DOOM’s appearance onCheat Codesrepresents a bit of unfinished business: Danger Mouse, who originally produced DOOM’s long-vaulted verse, had long wanted the Roots’ Black Thought for the track. What could’ve been an autumnal team-up between two all-time rap technicians became, with DOOM’s passing in 2020, a melancholic meeting across the veil. The Villain’s sardonic epitaph (“They knew he was a negro/So no need to show faces”) draws as much blood as the world’s longest Erik Estrada joke, while Black Thought’s polished yet playful verse is a tribute to the sly anarchy DOOM could elicit, whether or not he was in the room.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_49,2022,Free Yourself,Jesse Dorris,"The beloved British singer responsible for one of the pandemic’s premiere pop albums teamed up with studio whizz Stuart Price and returned this summer with another ode to love and dancing. “Free Yourself” takes Ware’s blend of ’70s disco and ’80s boogie and shimmies it ecstatically into the ’90s—jacking acid house drum fills, flamboyant male backup singers, gospel piano—without losing an ounce of charm. And when, this fall, she finally sang it live in front of a New York crowd pitched to Judy-at-Carnegie-Hall pandemonium? It became a new classic.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_48,2022,Light Me Up,Jane Bua,"“Light Me Up” is about the soft hope of a blossoming romance. The Steve Lacy-produced song begins with uncertainty, pacing in circles over tranquil bass guitar and kicks that pulse like a slowed heart. Lenae’s tender vocal runs descend like creek water as she describes the exhilaration of trying on someone new: “No coming down, I love the view.” The song’s private intensity makes it fit for a closed-doors affair in a candle-lit room, but Lenae’s weightless voice and quiet vulnerability makes it impossible not to want to listen in.",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_47,2022,Circles Around This Town,Stephen Deusner,"Maren Morris does the impossible: She makes driving in Nashville sound fun. A sly bit of memoir set to music, the first single fromHumble Questrecalls the singer’s earliest days as a Tennessee transplant, driving her “Montero with the AC busted” through traffic to look for a record deal and maybe find a little inspiration on the radio. It’s been a decade since she arrived in town, but she might as well be singing about what she did last weekend. She arrived in Nashville hungry.

2022_46,2022,Sticky,Dani Blum,"On an album that often sounds like he’s searching for something (novelty, if you’re being generous; relevance if you’re not), “Sticky” is where Drake issues his demands: for more guests at the Met Gala, for police escorts, for a kiss, requested in curling French-Canadian. Like the best Drake songs, “Sticky” pressure-cooks his brashest impulses until they congeal into something tender. The club closes; the neon lights sputter out, and “it’s you alone with your regrets.” The stickiest situations are always the ones that trap you in your own thoughts.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_45,2022,El Galatzó,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Lucrecia Dalt’s forceful whisper seems to lightly kiss the microphone, capturing the uncomfortable intimacy of another’s breath against your ear. A flute swirls in the stereo mix, and by the third minute of “El Galatzó,” the strings swell into a crescendo and her plaintive speech gives way to a soulful chorus of spirits. This is, of course, the alien Preta, the protagonist of her latest album¡Ay!, who arrives flush with newly realized erotic power, rejecting the illusion of linear time. It’s a blast of sci-fi folklore, with an anti-colonial POV. The songs and stories of our ancestors aren’t relegated to the past; that kind of temporality, Dalt suggests, is merely a misconception of the unevolved.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_44,2022,Anti-Hero,Puja Patel,"Sometimes the world really does revolve around Taylor Swift: Is there any other artist who could force urgency into the federal investigation of a music industry monopolyjust by going on tour? With “Anti-Hero,” Taylor mirrors an entire lifetime of being a coy main character—the bleacher seat-warmer, the “insane” jealous ex, the doomed princess—with one addictive, charming declaration of self-awareness. Her vocal theatrics are spiked with the very millennial instinct to disguise confidence with self-deprecation, using the tools of a generation obsessed with self-reflection to make one of the best pop songs of the year.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_43,2022,Western Wind,Jeremy D. Larson,"A “jubilation” conjures such a specific kind of party—maybe a little Catholic, maybe a little royal, something grand and elegant with streamers, champagne, castles. When Carly Rae Jepsen sings the word “jubilation” on “Western Wind”—a midtempoLive, Laugh, Lovepop song produced by Rostam from Jepsen’s album *The Loneliest Time—*it’s about a memory of her clearing aside all the furniture in her living room to make a space to sing and dance with her family. It’s so simple, so delightful, so inviting. The sneakily well-built song bubbles along softly, like a sleepy little “Freedom! ’90,” a road trip jam that can silence everyone in the car as Jepsen sings this question: “Do you feel home from all directions?” Not sure what it means, but like the best songs, the answer when you’re listening is an unequivocalyes.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_42,2022,Tastes Just Like It Costs,Philip Sherburne,"When MJ Lenderman’s guitar gently weeps, his songwriting keeps a stiff upper lip. Like everything on the indie rocker’s breakthrough albumBoat Songs, “Tastes Just Like It Costs” contrasts the looseness of his playing—a saggy opening riff reminiscent of Queens of the Stone Age, some curdled Dinosaur Jr. soloing—with the extreme economy of his lyrics. In a handful of four- and five-line verses, he sketches a scene appropriate for aPortlandiasketch, or maybe a horror film: an upscale butcher shop, a “dumb hat,” a sourceless scream. “Mm, honey/It tastes just like it costs,” he drawls over glowing charcoal fuzz, savoring the sweetness of the ambiguity.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_41,2022,It Hit Me,Sue Park,"On the Belgian electropop duo Charlotte Adigéry and Bolis Pupul’s debut LP,Topical Dancer, “It Hit Me” pierces through their theatrical scrim. Tackling the fraught subject of sexual spectacle—from the grimy discomfort of being leered at for the first time to the inane seduction techniques found in women’s magazines—“It Hit Me” guides us through the funhouse mirror of navigating one’s sexuality. The chorus underscores the weight of Adigéry and Pupul’s realizations, letting us feel the gut punch with them—and inviting us to dance through it all.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_40,2022,keisha,Tarisai Ngangura,"“keisha” is a breakup anthem made for a specific type of bad bitch: an independent woman who puts up with annoying “Where my hug at?” dudes, but still just wants to be loved and madly desired. Yaya Bey knows her audience is foul-mouthed, slightly toxic, lovestruck, and aroused by good, flirty conversation, so she adopts a feathery guitar riff that floats through the song. But when she sings the indelible chorus—“Yeah the pussy so, so good/And you still don’t love me”—it’s comedy and tragedy all rolled into one.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_39,2022,Plan B,Jessica Kariisa,"The high road is unsatisfying and often boring. Mud-slinging reveals something closer to the truth, and on “Plan B,” the truth sets the Houston Hottie free: “Fuck you, still can’t believe I used to trust you/The only accolade you ever made is that I fucked you.” Bolstered by a Jodeci sample, Meg spits with equal parts force and charisma, confronting not just the anger of a bad relationship but also the pain. Just ’cause you’re a bad bitch doesn’t mean you can’t have your feelings hurt.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_38,2022,Big Time,Brad Sanders,"Even the brightest-burning romances are made up of quiet moments. With “Big Time,” Angel Olsen gives listeners a glimpse into that kind of intimacy: She and her partner Beau Thibodeaux, who co-wrote the song, drink coffee, lay in the tall grass, and walk down to the lake, singing Chris de Burgh’s “The Lady in Red.” Olsen’s brassy, stuck-out-of-time voice and the breezy, country-inspired arrangement imbue those details with the gleam of universal truth. The sweetly delivered line “I’m loving you big time” is a beacon in Olsen’s hands. Its disarming simplicity cracks open her incandescent partnership, letting its light pour out all over everything.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_37,2022,Home Maker,Marcus J. Moore,"With the world coming back outside again, “Home Maker” shows that staying in the crib can be just as worthwhile. Sudan Archives sidesteps the opaque nature of some of her previous work for a straight-ahead introvert’s anthem. “I cry when I’m alone,” she coos atop propulsive drums and looping handclaps. “All these people don’t know/That I deal with all of these doubts.” Yet the song doesn’t wallow in sadness; it is empowered, therapeutic, and honest.",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_36,2022,Bites on My Neck,Jazz Monroe,"Part hyperpop cyborg, part suffering bedroom songwriter, yeule deals in emo-tinged laments that conceal deep, impossible desires: to be numb and euphoric at once; to be touched without a body. The Singaporean musician floats between dissociative sing-speak and lullaby coos on “Bites on My Neck,” corralling meteor-shower synths and pugilistic kick drums to offer a fresh perspective on pleasure-centric dance pop. Co-written and produced with Danny L Harle and Mura Masa, the track owes as much to M83’s starbound symphonies and Laurie Anderson’s deadpan alienation as to post-PC Music clubland. Yeule hijacks that garish pop paradigm in service of more vaporous emotions, funneling a post-breakup identity crisis into an immaterial rush.",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_35,2022,Midnight Legend,Madison Bloom,"When the drugs have run dry and you’re about to ditch the club, “Midnight Legend” will call you back. You hear those bouncing ’90s house keys, the synthetic snares that clack like costume jewelry on a cheap bartop. Special Interest vocalist Alli Logout pulls double duty: They are your disco deity, your rave therapist. “They all pine for you/Built you to destroy you,” Logout belts, before partner-in-crime Mykki Blanco slides in with a brassy verse. “Daddy pay the bill but I don’t fuck him,” Blanco snaps over a four-on-the-floor pulse. The divas have arrived—dancefloor salvation.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_34,2022,Shelly,Sam Goldner,"Grace Ives’Janky Starsprings to life like a miniature jukebox of sputtering New York love songs, each delectable hook blaring through with a raggedy kind of charm. Where most of the album channels the raunchy electro-pop of the aughts, “Shelly” calls out the oldies: its power poppy, guitar-chugging strut feels more of a piece withPulporRick Springfield. Ives cheekily lusts after a woman who reminds her of the titularTwin Peakscharacter, breathily proclaiming, “I wanna 1-2-3-4-5 her.” It’s as winking as it is sweetly sincere, like a parody of all those unrequited-love karaoke classics that’s so positively giddy it ends up becoming the real thing.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_33,2022,Spud Infinity,Jayson Greene,"What exactly is the connection between potatoes and human existence? Who knows. But the absurd central metaphor in Big Thief’s “Spud Infinity” makes it both the band's homeliest song and possibly their most beautiful, escaping like a big, snorty laugh from their murmuring double album,Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You. The mouth harp and see-sawing fiddle are the perfect accompaniment to Adrianne Lenker’s outrageously playful lyrics, rhyming “finish” with “potato knish” in a flourish that would make John Prine crack a mile-wide grin.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_32,2022,Bitch Where,Dylan Green,"Chief Keef is at an emotional crossroads. The Chicago native is still as wild and irreverent as ever (“At the gun range, sound checkin’, it sound clear”) but he’s also uncharacteristically grateful to still be alive and creating after a decade in the industry. “Bitch Where” plays these fantastical tonal leaps against a triumphant beat made for a king returning from war, but once the smoke clears, a message from Keef’s grandmother maintains the air of gratitude: “Keep going, baby. Keep going. Granny just love how you move and doing yourself.”",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_31,2022,Constant Repeat,Olivia Horn,"There are glimmers of Charli’s cyborg tendencies onCrashstandout “Constant Repeat”—the high-pitched blips, the sliced-and-diced vocal outro—but it moves more lightly ​​than the revved-up pop for which she’s become known. Charli is at ease, luxuriating in Jacuzzi-jet synths while delivering a resolute assertion of her worth to someone who let her go. Ostensibly about a breakup, the song becomes all the more potent consideringCrash’smeta-narrativeabout a fed-up pop star dipping out on her major-label overlords. Charli demands stardom on her own terms; the mainstream machine can take it or leave it.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_30,2022,Munch (Feelin’ U),Ryan Dombal,"Merriam-Webster defines “munch” as a verb that means “to eat with a chewing action.” Which is wrong. Or, at least, incomplete. Because according to Ice Spice, the word is a noun that describes a particularly clueless kind of guy—a dummy, a sucker, a simp. “You thought I was feelin’ you?” the Bronx drill rapper eyerolls on one of the year’s most memorable hooks, “That nigga a munch/Nigga a eater he ate it for lunch/Bitch I’m a baddie I get what I want.” Ice Spice grew up idolizing both Cardi B and Erykah Badu, and she balances her brashness with a supremely unbothered delivery, as if she’s been swatting away munches for decades. Centuries, even. Merriam-Webster, it’s time to catch up.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_29,2022,Greatest Hits,Louis Pattison,"A song called “Greatest Hits” might seem like hubris, but subversive audacity is encoded into Jockstrap’s DNA. On this highlight ofI Love You Jennifer B, the London duo takes the fundamentals of disco—sashaying glamor, sumptuous strings—and laces them with hyperpop mischief. “Imagine I’m Madonna/Imagine I’mtheMadonna,” vogues Georgia Ellery, self-actualizing her stardom. In an alternate reality, “Greatest Hits” is soundtracking a scene of eyebrow-raising decadence in Studio 54 at this very moment. In our timeline it’s playing out on less opulent stages, but even the humblest trappings can’t tarnish its sense of unabashed rapture.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_28,2022,Shotgun,Gio Santiago,"Sophie Allison was put on God’s green Earth to write vivid, melancholy songs. On “Shotgun,” the undulating lead single fromSometimes, Forever, she masters the complicated rush of falling into an unsustainable love, painting a twisted picture of twentysomething romances. “You know I’ll take you as you are/As long as you do me,” she sings over muddy layers of grungy guitar chords produced expertly by Oneohtrix Point Never. “Shotgun” is about doing vulnerable and delusional things in love, knowing they’re just quick fixes, and not giving a damn anyway.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_27,2022,Bad Habit,Clover Hope,"Steve Lacy is a lovelorn Eeyore on “Bad Habit,” hisGemini Rightsanthem for the undecided. He dutifully trods around in his own head, assuaging the guilt of not pursuing a love interest. Still, he allows himself to daydream. In a year that’s felt directionless for many, it’s clear why a song about living in ambiguity would become a No. 1 hit and every TikTok introvert’s soundtrack. More than the wispy pangs of regret or plaintive falsetto, what propels the song is a steady pulse of uncertainty, relatable to anyone who’s ever talked themselves out of following their heart.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_26,2022,Moderation,Quinn Moreland,"“Moderation,” a highlight of Cate Le Bon’sPompeii, is a beguiling elegy to uncertainty. Atop a strutting new wave bassline and lonesome horns, the Welsh musician faces the habits she can’t quite knock, reckoning with guilt and her own good intentions. “Moderation/I can’t have it/I don’t want it/I want to touch it,” she sings, lingering on each word as if to briefly possess its essence. In this strange space between emotions, Le Bon stands transfixed by the unknown.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_25,2022,Last Last,Will Pritchard,"Has heartbreak ever sounded so liberating? “Last Last” is Burna Boy’s paean to pain and things that, well, don’t last—his layered vocals soaring freely over lolloping kicks. But played against the charismatic defiance of his drink- and smoke-soaked performance is that shivering riff of Toni Braxton’s “He Wasn’t Man Enough”; it rings like eternal doubt—maybe itwasme, not you, after all?—and delivers the tension that triggered the song’s explosion across street parties and beach stages all summer.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_24,2022,Cherry,Daniel Bromfield,"Daphni’s third album,Cherry, feels like it was bashed out in a few hours, in the best possible way. It’s rave music as garage rock, with a giddy sense of freedom that makes it feels like a breakthrough for the dance-music project of Caribou’s Dan Snaith. Standing astride the record is the title track, composed of a few eccentric but judiciously arranged elements—a frog-chorus of pitch-shifted hi-hats, a simple melody played on a pneumatic chord preset—threaded along a synth loop that sounds like a chain of exploding Pop Rocks. Simply yet counterintuitively constructed, “Cherry” is proof a rave anthem can be patched together out of anything.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_23,2022,"It’s Not Just Me, It’s Everybody",Wood,"Natalie Mering transforms a biting moment of interiority—feeling unseen at a party—into a plea for empathy and interconnectivity. She notices the increasing loneliness in herself, then the loneliness in everyone, everywhere: a testament to the fact that we’re all “a part of one big thing.” The song beams with ’70s sonic nostalgia, Mering’s languid voice soaring over soft piano and taut drums. But the sentiments in “It’s Not Just Me, It’s Everybody” are hardly backwards-looking. Mering searches for a way forward, embracing mercy as a path to ourselves and each other. –Brady Brickner",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_22,2022,home,Cat Zhang,"Two Shell could really piss you off if their music wasn’t so fantastic. Forget the duo’s inane firstinterviewthat self-destructed before you could read it, or theirBoiler Roomset where they twiddled knobs to a pre-recorded set in goat hats and sunglasses. Forget the passcode-protected hacker website that makes you feel like you have to steal the Declaration of Independence to get in. It all evaporates in the face of a big, phosphorescent floor-filler like “home,” in which pitched-up vocals from a 2016 alt-R&Bsongemit an irresistible rainbow sheen, texturized by whirring jungle beats and slobbery bubble-popping noises. It’s dippy, synthetic, and blindingly fun, a sure sign that even at closing time your night is on the up.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_21,2022,We Not Humping (Remix),Heven Haile,"When pop-culture feminism goes full-throttle on misandry, the Miami bass-inflected “We Not Humping (Remix)” will be the movement’s rallying song. Equally bratty and lacerating, Monaleo and Flo Milli take turns using the alpha-male ego like a punching bag. Sparing no feelings, these Southern women giggle at erectile dysfunction, berating those who can only last for the duration of a TikTok video, and shaming the ones who failed Eater 101 in a playground-taunt delivery. Don’t worry, they just might let you hang—just come with your jaw loose and most importantly keep your pants zipped.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_20,2022,Billions,Sasha Geffen,"Caroline Polachek dives headfirst into the twists and turns of a mutually obliterative infatuation. She breathily gasps about “sexting sonnets” and “working the angles,” before plunging down an octave to seethe “headless angel / body upgraded / but it's dead on arrival.” And then a sharp turn: She hands off the final chorus to a British children's choir, whose voices sound so weightless they could be simulated. “I never felt so close to you,” they sing, modeling what all the best pop music does: taking a specific situation between a particularIand a particularyouand inviting everyone else in the world to fill it with their own dreams and nightmares.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_19,2022,Friday Night,Mark Richardson,"Beth Orton’s astonishing “Friday Night” captures the moment when a disarrayed consciousness finally arranges itself into a shape that makes sense. The haunted background vocals and vaporous synths suggest the time-travel of memory as much as the lyric about Proust’s madeleine, but Orton has no desire to live in the past. Though she’s a little unsteady, hobbling along to the tumbling beat of the drum, she’d rather move forward. As “Friday Night” unfolds, Orton sounds both weary and sneakily energized, ready to discover what’s next.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_18,2022,Ancestress,Madison Bloom,"Björk wrote “Ancestress,” a long and stirring highlight fromFossora, in the wake of her mother’s death. She penned pages of words before whittling them down and enlisting her son, Sindri Eldon, to harmonize. In the moments they sing together, Björk and Eldon sketch out a lifecycle, each honoring their own matriarch. Björk pays tribute to her mother’s dyslexia—an “idiosyncratic sense of rhythm” and the “ultimate free form.” But she doesn’t just sing about it: She echos it with musical structure, shoving aside delicate chimes and dispatching atonal bells and jagged percussion. “Ancestress” is not only a song about Björk’s mother; it is her mother transposed into song.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_17,2022,Midnight Sun,Nina Corcoran,"Play a round of Heardle with “Midnight Sun” and you might easily guess anIn Rainbowssong. Nilüfer Yanya translates Radiohead’s signature elements—minor-key trickery, layered guitar loops, cryptic lyrics punctuated with anxiety—into a heavily redacted diary entry. From the sharp intake of a drum roll that opens the song to the scuzzy, major-key blowout that offers a long-awaited catharsis, “Midnight Sun” uses rock’s ominous side to ward off an unidentified threat. Consider it a talisman for a new decade of misinformation, paranoia, and emotional spiraling.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_16,2022,The Heart Part 5,Adlan Jackson,"One of the worst strains of discourse in the field of Kendrickology is the idea that Kendrick Lamar never asked to be considered a spokesperson for the affairs of Black America, that he’s merely a savant that stumbled into a spotlight he’s not suited for, and never wanted. What an insult. “The Heart Part 5” is a three-hundred-and-thirty-two-second-long declaration of Kendrick’s unabashed desire for the pulpit, contending with whether the world no longer has use for his earnestness, and whether he should be ashamed to indulge his ambitions to moral superheroics. That’s actually exactly what the world wants, and it’s what Kendrick wants, too.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_15,2022,Heaven Come Crashing,Zhenzhen Yu,"Though Rachika Nayar’s previous works of gossamer ambient play along a rich spectrum of feeling, they often expressed their intensity softly. The first half of the Brooklyn guitarist-composer’s “Heaven Come Crashing” glides along in a familiar quietude, with clusters of vocals from fellow guitarist Maria BC. When it abruptly drops into a motorway-paced drum’n’bass section, the catharsis is surprising but earned, like a natural discharge of energy. Amid all the noise and rhythm, the familiar sound of a processed guitar becomes something new and majestic.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_14,2022,Cash In Cash Out,Heven Haile,"“Cash In Cash Out” sounds like Pharrell heard a Gen-Zer refer to him as “the Minions song guy” and took it personally. Returning to a grittier sound after his work on Pusha-T’sIt’s Almost Dry, he sought out two “ravenous wolves”—Tyler the Creator and 21 Savage—to attack extraterrestrial 808s and militant snares. Both rappers trade braggadocious bars, neither relegated to feature status—21 surfing the high-tempo beat while Tyler double-dutches with an increasingly frenetic flow culminating in his conclusive “Woof!”",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_13,2022,Part of the Band,Matthew Strauss,"“Part of the Band” is both the thesis and the outlier of the 1975’sBeing Funny in a Foreign Language. Its patient orchestral folk and tongue-twisting one-liners about “vaccinista tote bag chic baristas” stand apart from the bittersweet synth-pop found elsewhere on the album. The song’s vulnerability feels distinct in its precision, too. As frontman Matty Healy sings of exactly how long it’s been since he last used heroin, down to the minute, toward the end of the track, the production swells to a crescendo, pushing him further ahead.",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_12,2022,Fever,Zach Schonfeld,"Nobody darts around the edges of narrative and inscrutability quite like the folk-pop enigma Aldous Harding. On “Fever,” the New Zealand singer deals out impressionistic morsels of an 11-day love affair in a faraway city, shouting the first word of each measure like a schoolteacher calling roll. “Fever” may seem like a straightforward tale by Harding’s cryptic standards, but from the lopsided piano groove that anchors the tune to the dada wisdom that “one will fry if the other’s connected,” everything remains pleasantly askew.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_11,2022,American Teenager,Nadine Smith,"Ethel Cain approaches her music as a sound designer as much as a songwriter, eschewing conventional structure for marginal vibrations and layered sensations, which makes an arena-ready pop anthem like “American Teenager” something of a revelation. On a lost highway turnoff somewhere between Bruce Springsteen and Brandon Flowers, Ethel rides a sepia-tinged carousel of all-American imagery: tears under the bleachers, wasted nights gone wrong, and forlorn prayers to Jesus. While her songs are frequently extended epics, somewhere between slowcore and chopped & screwed choral music, “American Teenager” is immediate and succinct, but not any less careful in its construction.",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_10,2022,Somewhere Near Marseilles,Eric Torres,"Hikaru Utada reinvented themselves on their eighth album,BADモード, dialing from J-pop toward sleek, mellow dance music. Featuring co-production from Floating Points’ Sam Shepherd, the LP’s jet-setting, showstopping finale frames a Mediterranean tryst in finger snaps and rubbery synths. It’s a glamorous setup for breathless intimacy: “Maybe I’m afraid of love/Say I’m not the only one,” they murmur as the song builds toward a blissed-out dance breakdown. Spiked with unfettered yearning, “Somewhere Near Marseilles” makes falling hard and fast sound like its own euphoric form of escape.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_9,2022,Tití Me Preguntó,Alfred Soto,"Bad Bunny regards seductive mischief as inextricable from his sensitive disposition: This is how he lets us know he’s complex. The arrangement reflects Bunny’s amiable disregard for monogamy. Producer MAG treats Bunny’s first solo stab at dembow like a coming-out party, lavishing him with keyboard swirls, sampled camera effects, a beat switch-up in the outro, and, terrifyingly, his aunt to shake her finger at her nephew. But Tití doesn’t have to ask for details—Benito will tell her. He giggles at his own admissions, and of course, like cads before him, admits that what hereallywants is… love.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_8,2022,Step by Step,Evan Minsker,"French house kingpins Alan Braxe and DJ Falcon made their long-awaited return on “Step by Step,” rolling out gentle waves of modular synths that sound like they come from an old AM radio. Panda Bear gives the duo’s subtle glow a narrative framework, singing about the aftermath of an idyllic past. But “Step by Step” is really about moving forward: The synths suddenly come alive, acoustic drums breathe momentum into the song’s sails, and Panda Bear—multi-tracked into an elated choir, and delivering the crown jewel of his already laudable 2022 discography—becomes a chorus of trusted advisors whose collective force, and copious repetitions, transform an old self-help chestnut into a life-changing belief system.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_7,2022,SAOKO,Olivia Horn,"Pressing play on “SAOKO” feels like opening a matchbox to find a blaze already lit inside. It’s the crackling, compact powerhouse that realizes Rosalía’s stated desire tohear something she’s never heard before. In just over two minutes, she darts through a Wisin and Daddy Yankeeinterpolation, digital distortion, and organic, jazzy interludes while laying bars harder than the diamonds she affixed to her teeth this year. “Yo me transformo”—“I transform myself”—is her refrain throughout, and a mission statement for how she synthesizes cross-cultural influences into a totalizing, transcendent vision of pop.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork

On the cinematic lead single from their first album in eight years, Yeah Yeah Yeahs obliquely trace the contours of our consequential historical moment, of what the young will inherit: “Cowards, here’s the sun/So bow your heads.” Its atmosphere conjures a world slowly turning, putting rage into a cool, cutting stare.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_5,2022,Alien Superstar,Emma Carmichael,"At least now we’ll be prepared if a UFO ever touches down in the club. “Alien Superstar” is a new-gen ballroom staple with a synth-drenched hook beamed down from a higher plane. Beyoncé has never lacked for confidence, but over Prince-ly funk paired with interstellar electronic flourishes, her assertions about being a “masterpiece, genius” with a “drip intravenous” feel particularly justified. Add to the audaciousness a grouping of samples that, were it not for the House of Yoncé’s copious resources, would surely never have been assembled under one roof: Dancefloor staplesForemost PoetsandPeter Rauhofermeet aRight Said Fredinterpolation that culminates in anoutroby Barbara Ann Teer, founder of the National Black Theater.

2022_4,2022,Runner,Anna Gaca,"Alex G writes songs because,he says, he doesn’t have the “technical skill” for fiction. Probably you would not get a book deal on this premise: “Runner” might be a song about a dog, but it’s also a song aboutdog spelled backward. “I have done a couple bad things,” he howls, the tortured Judas cry of that most Easter bunnies-and-puppies of Alex G albums,God Save the Animals. “Judge me for what I do,” he reminds us, and as is true of many spiritual texts, the detail is kind of inscrutable while the story comes alive in sound: creeping-ivy melodies, spooky beatboxing, that primal scream. The scream leaves the human realm, meets the animal, approaches the perfect love to which we now aspire in the form of perfect two-and-a-half-minute pop songs.

(Let’s Go),Heven Haile,"Landing like a crunkafied version of Trina’s “Single Again” but witha rowdy Lil Phat on the chorus, Glorilla’s “F.N.F.” is a flashy relationship-status update that makes a breakup feel like a riot. Instead of solitary nights spent crying over a tub of ice cream, Glo goes looking for debauchery with her home girls, leading the charge into the streets with an invigorating “Let’s goooo!!!!” Flanked by her bad bitch army, she stomps over a thunderous HitKidd beat and has the last laugh over an ex who wasted her time: “Life's great, pussy still good/Still eating cake, wishing that a bitch would.” Don’t even try texting: Glorilla’s too busy twerking at intersections, hanging out car windows, and making the world know she’sfree.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_2,2022,June,Sam Sodomsky,"“Speaking of lifelike,thisis what life’s like,” Dan Bejar declares midway through “June,” a gloriously surreal destination following three decades of journeying into the heart of his subconscious. The Canadian songwriter’s spoken-word vocals are processed to sound like a montage of various Dan Bejars complimenting and contradicting one another, musing on art and existence or cracking an “I barely know her!” joke while pondering the meaning of love. The onslaught of non sequiturs is chopped and layered against wafting disco, like the soundtrack to a mirrorball head-trip sequence in the Hollywood adaptation of his life. If we’re to take him at his word, this reallyiswhat life is like—alternately gliding in ecstasy and waging war on each passing thought, all while still making time for the everyday absurdity that falls in between. A crown jewel of one of indie rock’s most ambitious songbooks, “June” found its home in a world that seems as absurd, doomed, and oddly romantic as Bejar has always seen it.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2022_1,2022,Belinda Says,Jamieson Cox,"Alvvays frontwoman Molly Rankin recently cited the Canadian short story master Alice Munro as an influence, noting the way the writer’s work can “knock the wind out of you.” Rankin and her band offer their own bracing wallop with “Belinda Says,” a heartbreaking sketch of an unexpected pregnancy that’s also a modern power-pop classic. She only needs one line to render vivid scenes: a warm vodka cooler chugged behind a hockey rink, a tense phone call with a would-be father, a forlorn move to the countryside soundtracked by Belinda Carlisle’s “Heaven Is a Place on Earth.” Like a heroine in one of Munro’s timeless stories, the narrator’s life is altered forever by a single choice of impossible magnitude. The song’s bittersweet, sighing melody, one that could easily be repurposed within an antique music box, is magnified by production that weaponizes shoegaze signifiers in service of the narrative. Guitars smother like wet wool and shrieking seagulls fly over the coast; there's an overwhelming heightening of stakes, like your heart is being squeezed by a trash compactor. As Rankin soars into a final high note, it might feel like you’re leaving with a whiff of hope—but the solo that takes you home is messy, discordant, a little confused. It’s an appropriate finale for a song about the moments in people’s lives that defy clear articulation, when your only choice is surrender to a swirling maelstrom of emotion.",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2022,Pitchfork
2023_100,2023,Stage of Love,Jill Mapes,"On her first solo single, former CCFX crooner Mary Jane Dunphe describes a solitary, disorienting view of longing. The boiling point of her sensory confusion is right on the surface, bubbling out of the blown-out bass, tactile beats, and feral, distorted guitar riff. Dunphe’s deep voice seems to move in slow motion as she surveys the chaos. “Love is giving something you don’t have to someone who doesn’t want it,” wrote the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, a scary thought at the heart of Dunphe’s battle cry. It’s reason enough to stay single.",100,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_99,2023,La Alhambra,Madison Bloom,"Catalan experimental artist Marina Herlop once likened her music to a huffing monster that expands and deflates like an accordion. That sense of tension and release underlies this year’s Nekkuja, but with her contrasts manifesting as spiky peaks and plunging depths. The prismatic single “La Alhambra” is among the album’s most striking pieces: Between plucked guitar and blasts of bass drum, Herlop’s sweet, glitchy harmonies shoot out like shafts of light penetrating a cracked cave ceiling. She ramps up the drama with moments of near silence; skittering electronics rustle before Herlop stacks her vocal layers like a pyramid of glinting gold bars. The higher she piles them, the more they sparkle.",99,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_98,2023,LADY GAGA,Nadine Smith,"Génesis, the breakout album from the Guadalajara-based vocalist Peso Pluma, effortlessly combines the material hustle and hypebeast style of American rap with the traditional acoustic sound and storytelling form of Mexican corridos. Over the percussive thump of a guitarrón and the nostalgic stirring of a 12-string bajo sexto, the unexpected superstar opines upon the numbing effects of his newfound fame, his throaty rasp like a high-pitched trumpet next to the smoother voices of Rancho Humilde signee Junior H and singer-songwriter Gabito Ballestros. Pluma takes the name for this single from a Lady Gaga-licensed line of Dom Pérignon rosé, a celebratory reference point for an artist who has transcended the assumed borders of so-called ""regional Mexican"" music.",98,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_97,2023,Delete It,Ryan Leas,"The first time MSPAINT played a hardcore festival outside their native Mississippi, vocalist Deedee had a chance encounter: finding Militarie Gun frontman Ian Shelton navigating a pre-show panic attack. The two connected and developed a lasting bond as weirdo outsiders adjacent to the scene. Eventually, Shelton helped guide MSPAINT as the co-producer of their debut album, and guest vocalist on its standout, “Delete It.” With lyrics about struggling to live in the moment, their collaboration plays like a long-lost ’90s alt-rock anthem, plunged through these artists’ idiosyncratic filters.",97,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_96,2023,Yeezy Boots,Ian Cohen,"In all of the debate over Kanye West’s place in our current cultural climate, no one has gotten to the point as quickly as RXK Nephew: “Jay-Z don’t even like you,” “the whole G.O.O.D. Music made bad music,” and most damningly, “you signed Big Sean.” The latest in the Rochester rapper’s ongoing series of appointment-listening diss tracks, “Yeezy Boots” works well enough as a litany of opinions about Kanye’s rapping (mediocre), street credibility (non-existent), haircut (dumbass) and shoes (same). But it’s also a meditation on an important concern for RXK Nephew, whose utter disregard for social propriety puts his career at risk nearly every time he drops a track: just how much out-of-pocket shit can someone say before they suffer actual consequences? “They doing Kanye like R. Kelly/I don’t care, I don’t wanna hear his music,” Neph mutters, knowing damn well that most of Ye’s sins would be absolved if he was still making hits.",96,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_95,2023,Go Dig My Grave,Stephen M. Deusner,"A boy courts and then rejects a young woman. She returns home and hangs herself. Under various titles, this story has been sung countless times over the centuries. Dublin band Lankum recast it in light of the recent folk horror film revival; their version conveys an ambient dread akin to The Witch and A Dark Song. The spare arrangement opens with Radie Peat’s keening vocals and builds to a climax of queasy strings and death march percussion that’s more Bauhaus than “Barbara Allen.” The horror lies in the steadiness of it all, in its terribly unrelenting pulse and drone: Every thrum is a shovelful of dirt on your casket.",95,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_94,2023,WHERE SHE GOES,Erin Macleod,"For months after its release in May, Benito stans filled Reddit threads arguing over the creative merits of “WHERE SHE GOES,” and whether it went anywhere worthwhile at all. But the moody, New Jersey club-fueled banger offers just enough starts, stops, and beat drops to mirror his musings about infidelity. (A star-studded video featuring Lil Uzi Vert, Frank Ocean, and Ronaldinho simply adds to the fun foray into Bad Bunny’s relationship fuckery.) The song’s sprawling synths, brawny bass, and huge, soaring chorus meant “WHERE SHE GOES” only gained momentum through the year, becoming a ubiquitous song of the summer.",94,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_93,2023,New York Transit Queen,Stephen Kearse,"“New York Transit Queen” transforms a 1954 archival photo of a Black pageant winner riding a fire engine into a riot grrrl anthem. Corinne Bailey Rae, first known for bashful and yearning mid-2000s pop, debuts her shriek while narrating her subject’s joyous commute. The queen swells with potential as Rae and co-producer S.J. Brown soundtrack the raucous ride with clamoring drums, roaring guitar chords, and schoolyard handclaps that build into a wall of rhythm. Rae doesn’t give her a destination, but she’s obviously going places.",93,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_92,2023,Nothing Left to Lose,Cameron Cook,"While married couple Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt have had their hands full with creative projects over the past two decades, it was a welcome surprise when their beloved group Everything But the Girl released Fuse early this year. The album highlight “Nothing Left to Lose” picks up where 1999’s Temperamental left off. Watt’s icy, slinky, and carefully structured production hides outsized emotions beneath garage’s lithe profile. Thorn’s exquisite, melancholic alto sings of the unbreakable bond between love and pain. “Kiss me while the world decays,” she pleads with the kind of passion that explains the duo’s reputation as dance music’s dreamiest couple.",92,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_91,2023,Desolation’s Flower,Sam Sodomsky,"Ragana specialize in slow-moving, starkly arranged epics that gain power from how little is happening: a repeated phrase that gets under your skin as the volume increases, a sinister guitar riff that gathers momentum the more familiar it becomes, a pounding kickdrum that reverberates deep in your chest. “Desolation’s Flower,” the blown-out title track to the Pacific Northwest duo’s debut album for The Flenser, tethers this minimalist philosophy to a righteous rally cry. “Holy are the names,” they sing in remembrance of their queer and trans ancestors guiding them toward this moment. Together, they hold tight to their enduring values in a complicated world.",91,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_90,2023,"Darkness, Darkness",Will Hermes,"As Four Tet, Kieran Hebden has been blueprinting new possibilities for mixing beats and samples of acoustic instruments for more than two decades. Unsurprisingly, this union with William Tyler, the virtuoso finger-picking journeyman, is a perfect match. Centered on a thick chunk of “Darkness, Darkness,” a 1969 obscurity from soul-pop singer turned Days of Our Lives actress Gloria Loring, the song is a 10-plus-minute slow-burner that builds from psych-folk meditation to mid-’70s Miles Davis-style supernova, with Tyler channeling forefathers like Sonny Sharrock and Pete Cosey as Hebden shell-games the rhythms. The producer says a full album is on the way; it should be a mindbender.",90,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_89,2023,Pa Que Baile,Tatiana Lee Rodriguez,"Saturated in Willy Wonka theatrics and slippery wordplay, Kiko el Crazy’s album Pila’e Teteo saved 2023 from a dembow drought. Opener “Pa Que Baile” hits with the force of a defibrillator to the eardrums, with an irresistible dancehall vocal loop that sucks you into the Dominican Republic’s neon underbelly like molly-water through a silly straw. In Kiko’s street utopia, ass-shaking is the highest currency, gangsters empty their clips toward the skies, and familiar pop references are reimagined as bachata remixes. He also bites back on Rosalía’s Dominican phase—when she pickpocketed his signature phrase “la pampara,” tried bachata, and befriended Tokischa—by recycling her own flamenco hand claps and “Linda” melody for a playful Caribbean repossession. He even channels his inner “Rich Girl” in the chorus, subverting yet another famed pop culture vulture. But here, everyone has all the money in the world.",89,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_88,2023,Amapiano,Harry Tafoya,"Underpinning Asake’s freewheeling cool is an epic striving for greatness. “Amapiano” is a concentrated blast of the Nigerian artist at his most charismatic and braggadocious, both a salute to the titular South African genre and his own swaggering stamp on it. Between trading boasts with rapper Olamide, Asake builds out the track’s skeletal house pulse and snaking log drum bass with sauntering Afrobeat melodies and a rousing chorus. In his attention to detail and sense of purpose, Asake elevates the song’s everyday hedonism into a hard-partying hero’s quest.",88,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_87,2023,Face Down,Claire Shaffer,"“Face Down” is a welcome reminder of City Girls’ propensity for churning out X-rated bangers. Flipping one of 2 Live Crew’s most notoriously obscene hooks, the duo dishes out trademark manifestos on scheming men over a riotous bounce beat. Even as Yung Miami and JT have spent more time as moguls and models than as rappers in recent years, “Face Down” proves that their raucous formula can still clock out hits.",87,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_86,2023,VAMPIROS,Ben Cardew,"Darker than Depeche Mode, weirder than Wednesday Addams, Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro’s “Vampiros” is 2023’s most tenderly terrifying work of gothic storytelling. Over a grotesque bass lurch, a warped choral effect, and a gravelly dembow beat that hits like clumped earth on a coffin lid, the (one-time) lovers trace a bedeviled fairy tale of late-night misadventure. The song’s wildly addictive chorus and air of doomed romance cements the duo’s place as the Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin of the Rue Morgue.",86,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_85,2023,Rumble,Dani Blum,"Skrillex is back; Skrillex never really left. Instead, he simply morphed along with each mutation of sweaty, bro-beloved electronic music—after cementing his stamp on dubstep, he pumped out tingling, EDM-infected Top 40 hits, and now he pops up at Coachella as a mediating force between Four Tet’s airy thumps and Fred again..’s sentimental bangers. After a quiet few years, Skrillex came through with two albums this year, and “Rumble” is a pyrotechnic highlight from those records—an enthusiastic return to ruckus. Veteran grime rapper Flowdan snarls between strobing bass hits. Fred again.. helps slam home effect after effect: lion roars, water plops. The beat whirrs and whirls, sounding like wind buffeting through a helicopter’s rotors. No one ever accused Skrillex of subtlety, and this is prime in-your-face fun.",85,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_84,2023,Fruit Loop,Dylan Green,"Flo Milli knows how to take the high of a sugar rush and knock a listener in the chest with it. “Fruit Loop” ramps that energy up until it snaps. She delivers simple, cutting bars like “You bitches really weak and you just talk online” and the laugh-out-loud diss “Tryna talk big but he got a lil pee-pee” with a peppy vindictiveness, like Harley Quinn faking a conversation with someone while holding a candy-coated mallet behind her back.",84,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_83,2023,Ebony Eye,Rich Juzwiak,"Yves Tumor’s latest album goes out ascending. Backed by triumphant strings, a propulsive “Umbrella”-esque beat, and a choir, Tumor trains their eyes to the heavens on “Ebony Eye,” the transcendent closer of Praise a Lord Who Chews… This is one of 2023’s premier shoulda-been singles—and, with good reason, Tumor’s personal favorite track on the album. Few could complain if such a grand finale suggested where this constantly shapeshifting artist is headed next.",83,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_82,2023,Johnny Dang,Adlan Jackson,"That Mexican OT, a newcomer from Bay City, Texas with enough charisma to pull Houston rap-and-grill royalty Paul Wall for a guest verse, beams like a movie star in the exuberant video for “Johnny Dang,” clutching the song’s namesake jeweler like they’re brothers. What’s more, OT tells us how his Cadillac is doing jumping jacks and his semi-automatic sounds like bubble wrap. Even an eliminated opp gets a “bubble bath.” It’s all fun and games. “I’m just rhyming words, I don’t even know how to rap,” he titters, showing off his masterful, hilarious approach on the hook of this year's sunniest Southern rap confection.",82,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_81,2023,Float,Clover Hope,"“Float” embodies the kind of lightness experienced only by babies and spiritual gurus. Over a casually sublime brass backdrop that sounds like an HBCU marching band invading a luxe spa, a flirty, peacocking Janelle Monáe relishes shedding baggage and choosing a more unburdened life. If stress is a lifelong affliction, this song suggests the best recourse is to exhale, perhaps strip naked, and let those troubles roll off your bare back.",81,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_80,2023,Good Lies,Kieran Press-Reynolds,"On the title track of their debut album as Overmono, dance producers (and brothers) Tom and Ed Russell dissect and rearrange Smerz’s hallucinatory “No harm” like plastic surgeons for hire, facelifting the Norwegian duo’s murky R&B into an ecstatic festival anthem. Every inch of enigmatic unease lurking around the original vocals is shaved off, resulting in something like the soundtrack to meeting the love of your life while walking across the Williamsburg Bridge at golden hour. A clever stroke of emotional alchemy, “Good Lies” flips its source material’s defensive crouch into an airbrushed head-rush of sweet possibility.",80,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_79,2023,uHhH HuH.Mp3,Sam Goldner,"If TisaKorean is primarily known for firing out dance rap tracks as chaotically as a toddler banging on their toy xylophone, “uHhH HuH.Mp3” stands apart for how much he actually lets the track breathe. Not that the Houston rapper is any less manic. Bouncing off a beat with all the head-knocking lurch of vintage Neptunes, he happily flaunts his influences, mixing up snap and crunk into a slurry of adlibs alongside his girlfriend Sunny Galactic. Pumping up its addictive synth hook as if he were inflating a giant balloon, “uHhH HuH.Mp3” is proof that TisaKorean doesn’t always need to disorient us into dancing—when duty calls, he can also lay down the muscle.",79,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_78,2023,To be honest,Owen Myers,"On “To be honest,” Christine and the Queens scales a mountain of self-actualization, shedding earthly anxieties—heartbreak, gender dysphoria—as he ascends toward the pearly gates of enlightenment. Uplifted by swirling synths and angelic coos, he heralds a Franglais party in the clouds where vulnerabilities can be belted out and no shadow self goes without a toast. Lofty as it all sounds, “To be honest” is Chris’ easiest-to-love song in years; at its beatific apex, it practically glows from within.",78,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_77,2023,kisses,Stuart Berman,"Slowdive’s second post-comeback album, everything is alive, leans toward the more meditative and overcast end of the shoegaze pioneers’ aesthetic spectrum. But partway through, “kisses” punches a moon-sized hole through the haze to let all the feelings come gushing out. While this winsome indie-pop reverie may be a sonic outlier, it nonetheless complements the record’s thematic preoccupation with the passage of time. Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell channel the rush of young romance via the music that soundtracked their youth, with crystalline Cure guitars and a chorus that would make New Order swoon in approval.",77,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_76,2023,Thank Allah,Mano Sundaresan,"The Boston Celtics, Niontay’s favorite basketball team, don’t need your approval. By the luck of the Irish and the grit of each possession, they’ll outwork and out-magic your team to victory. This is how listening to the Brooklyn-via-Kissimmee rapper’s muted opus “Thank Allah” feels: No drums, no frills, just bars and a prayer, his warm Florida flows snaking around swampy keyboard and squiggly bass. As Niontay’s dizzying verse unfurls across various plays, Irish goodbyes and trips across the map, he remains poised and cold-blooded, like a buzzer beater in slow-motion: “Get a bag and go home, nigga, it's the playoffs / Took a nigga shit, took his work, ain’t no days off.” When the drums finally kick in at the end, it’s like confetti raining down on TD Garden.",76,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_75,2023,Maria,Marissa Lorusso,"How horrifying to realize—maybe at a party, talking to an acquaintance—that the story you’ve just decided to tell is utterly wrong for your current conversation. This is one way to understand Greg Mendez’s hauntingly beautiful “Maria,” which opens with Mendez admitting he’s afraid to “tell you about some dumb shit” before doing so anyway. As the anxious melody lurches forward against strummed guitar, Mendez gives a plainspoken revelation about the intertwined heartaches of addiction and love, and a reminder that the stories we choose to tell can say just as much about us as any particular narrative.",75,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_74,2023,None of Us Have But a Little While,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"A Lonnie Holley performance, by nature, is ephemeral: The multi-disciplinary artist never plays something the same way twice, making every set a unique experience. So each of his albums is a privilege—the only way to put his moments of magic on repeat. This particular recording, from his latest LP, Oh Me Oh My, is a yearning riff on the impermanence of life itself. With a weathered voice, the 73-year-old sings of the struggles of existence and reminds us that it will be over all too soon. As Sharon Van Etten’s haunting croon harmonizes with the static of Holley’s synthesizer, they offer a gorgeous and melancholic plea to live in the moment.",74,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_73,2023,Census Designated,Daniel Bromfield,"Jane Remover has already pioneered (and moved on from) at least two digitally addled micro-genres in her short career, becoming a cult hero in certain corners of the internet while still in her teens. On “Census Designated,” the title track of her second album, the now-20-year-old gets a charge out of being young, successful, and having—or, more cynically, being—a product that everybody wants. Yet she’s also acutely aware of how dangerous show business can be for those who find early success, and the language she uses to describe herself (“barely legal,” “young blood,” “fresh meat”) is no less alarming than the hair-raising music behind it: a slow-mo explosion of glitching guitars, leading to an ending where the whole song crumples into ash.",73,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_72,2023,2HUMPY Anthem,Jude Noel,"The Philly club rap crew 2Humpy debuted in early May with an animated On the Radar freestyle that showcased their watertight chemistry, belting punchlines and ad-libs in unison as they gathered shoulder-to-shoulder around a single mic; by Halloween, they had broken up. In between, they dropped one of the year’s most delirious party anthems. While 2023’s pop landscape was littered with half-assed rehashes of bygone hits, the group’s eponymous posse cut succeeds as an ouroboros of nostalgia, fusing flows swiped from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock’s “It Takes Two,” a flip of the iconic saxophone sample from Public Enemy’s “Rebel Without a Pause,” and hypnotic 808 kicks that thread two decades of Jersey and Philly club innovation together. Maybe we just didn’t deserve 2Humpy.",72,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_71,2023,MÁQUINA CULONA,Maria Eberhart,"Ralphie Choo didn’t grow up listening to pop music. The Spanish singer spent his youth surrounded by his mom’s flamenco faves, artists like Camarón de la Isla and Paco de Lucía, and these traditional influences only enhance Choo’s genre-defying style—a kaleidoscopic mix of reggaeton, hip-hop, and, yes, flamenco, which stands apart from almost everything else in Spanish-language pop right now. “MÁQUINA CULONA,” a highlight from his debut album Supernova, is a modern take on cumbia that fuses electric accordion with pulsing squelches. Choo flits between heavily Auto-Tuned vocals and softer crooning as he admires a woman’s particularly large culo. Some things never get old.",71,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_70,2023,Name of God,Vrinda Jagota,"The isolation of grief has a way of bringing us together in surprising ways. Toronto poet and musician Mustafa wrote “Name of God” after his brother was killed and, throughout the gentle guitar ballad, he questions his faith while finding comfort in the Sudanese-Canadian community he grew up around. The striking music video shows Mustafa riding a motorcycle in a traditional jalabiya, with the Sudanese flag flowing from his back like a cape, and the song ends with a scratchy recording of one of his cousins declaring, “I am a human and Muslim.” While this complicated ode to heritage is deeply personal, it has also moved listeners to use the video’s YouTube comments to share virtual hugs and mourn the lives lost recently in Palestine and Sudan. Its head is down, and its arms are open.",70,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_69,2023,Sprinter,Louis Pattison,"The animating query at the center of this song is basically: How many women can you fit in a minibus? Both Dave and Central Cee have handled weightier topics, but “Sprinter” reminds us a good time doesn’t need to be deep. To a delicate strum of Spanish guitar, the silver-tongued London MCs riff on getting paid and getting girls; the lines are smart, the rizz impeccable. “Heard that girl is a gold digger,” deadpans Dave, “It can’t be true if she dated you.” “Sprinter” topped the UK charts for 10 weeks, making it the country’s longest-running No. 1 UK rap single ever. That it feels almost shrugged-off only makes its dominance that much more impressive.",69,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_68,2023,Skeleton Is Walking,Margeaux Labat,"Though Blake Mills is known for his meticulousness as a songwriter, guitarist, and producer, “Skeleton Is Walking” ambles along like a spontaneous jam—and is better for it. Mills and jazz musician Chris Weisman’s textured guitar interplay casts an air of reflection throughout the slowly building track, as Mills ruminates on peacemaking, redemption, and the passage of time. It all culminates in a rare indulgence for Mills: a distorted guitar solo that would make Robert Fripp proud.",68,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_67,2023,Push Power ( a 1 ),Daniel Felsenthal,"Best known for sparse, heady, and sometimes beatless compositions, vaunted English electronic producer Actress incites the dancefloor with a musical tug-of-war on “Push Power ( a 1 ).” Insistent four-on-the-floor bass hits pull at a searching piano line, while repetitive ad-libs offer enigmatic color commentary on the action. The terse vocals are hypnotic, but also lucid, crisp, and ready for the club, befitting a song that captures a cerebral standard-bearer as he gets kinetic.",67,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_66,2023,Tiny Garden,Allison Hussey,"Jamila Woods finds abundance in humility and incremental growth on “Tiny Garden.” Despite confessing her “iceberg heart,” the Chicago R&B auteur embraces self-discovery as she digs into a burgeoning relationship. “It’s gonna be a tiny garden, but I feed it every day,” she sings. When she shifts into the chorus, a cushy pad of bass blooms behind her, and melodic dapples of keys peek through the mix like rays of late-afternoon sun. New York singer-songwriter duendita’s guest verse, which recalls the encouragements of Des’ree’s “You Gotta Be,” adds another tender layer to the track. “Tiny Garden” celebrates the heart as a place where wild and beautiful feelings can thrive, as long as it’s tended to with care.",66,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_65,2023,Shmackin Town,Shy Thompson,"Rambunctious Milwaukee rapper AyooLii’s catalog is vast, including over 150 YouTube uploads in 2023 alone, but one thing is clear across his many, many songs: He wants everyone to know he’s got jokes. “Shmackin Town” feels like a tossed-off gag brought to life, as it flips Lipps Inc.’s wedding-reception staple “Funkytown” into an absurdist celebration of AyooLii’s hometown sound. Producer 2PHONENOAH adds the booming bass and four-on-the-floor beat that are everywhere in Milwaukee, while AyooLii rattles off one-liners about girls whose butt lifts he paid for—one because her booty was flat, and another because her booty was fat.",65,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_64,2023,Moonlight,Alfred Soto,"With an extraterrestrial’s sense of discovery, Kali Uchis notes that love between two human beings can be so wonderful all across her third album, Red Moon in Venus. She sings of messy sheets and spilled wine in a fluttery rasp that suggests deserved exhaustion. And on “Moonlight,” the Colombian-American artist hones her R&B credentials, slipping into Spanish to share her dirtiest thoughts. She wants to get high with her lover? Sure, why not. With a bassline that undulates like a waterbed, Uchis looks in the mirror and imagines what could be.",64,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_63,2023,Blind,Isabelia Herrera,"SZA is the poet laureate of love’s excruciating complications, and “Blind” is packed with the kind of searingly uncomfortable truths about damaged relationships that have inhabited an entire generation’s consciousness. Every painful admission of sexual desire, emotional deficiency, and romantic suffering is compounded by the cherubic plucking of a harp or a soul-severing string crescendo. When she raps, you can feel her claws protracting, muscles tightening in defense against the man coming for her heart. But her sung falsettos bear the ache of someone undone by their own needfulness. When your pussy precedes you, and your past can’t escape you, you don’t always know how to honor the love that resides in you. “Blind” dreams of security and self-assurance, but as bell hooks says, even radical love offers no place of safety.",63,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_62,2023,Hunter,Stephen Deusner,"On “Hunter,” a song about the indignities of dating as a newly single person in a big city, Jess Williamson memorably declares that her love is “honest as an ashtray.” The simile is a puzzle, something to be pondered over repeated listens, but on a gut level it also just rings true. This is how Williamson’s music works. A native Texan who embraced her twang after moving to the West Coast, she writes songs not to tell us something, but to figure something out about herself—in this case, how a discouraging experience can sharpen her resolve: “I’m a hunter for the real thing,” she sings, resolutely.",62,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_61,2023,Fentanyl Tester,Bhanuj Kappal,"Picture this: You’re cutting it up on the dancefloor when you realize—all too late—that you’ve been too indiscriminate in your drug use. Reality glitches. Time goes non-linear. Your fun night out is suddenly about to become a wild, white-knuckle ride into the abyss. “Fentanyl Tester” exists in the queasy, amphetamine-fuelled delirium of that moment. JPEGMAFIA layers subterranean bass and frenetic drum breaks over chopped-up, helium-speed samples of Kelis’ “Milkshake,” marrying the velocity of ’90s jungle with hyperpop’s ADHD whiplash. He and Danny Brown trade frantic bars about Molly and Marmaduke, the words tumbling out so fast you can barely parse them. There’s no respite, no empty spaces to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and hope you make it to the other side in one piece.",61,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_60,2023,Pretty in Possible,Margeaux Labat,"Amid the deep yearning and conceptual romance of Desire, I Want to Turn Into You, “Pretty in Possible” throws meaning to the wayside, choosing abstraction to summon the unpredictability of love. Caroline Polachek free-flows over a shuffling breakbeat, channeling the vocal stylings of Imogen Heap and Suzanne Vega, along with the cinematic strings of Massive Attack. She takes us through the bustling streets of her mind, slipping past volcanoes, blood, and drowning insects. It’s a trip that’s as intoxicating as it is confounding.",60,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_59,2023,Love Who We Are Meant To,Grayson Haver Currin,"Leslie Feist’s sixth album, Multitudes, functions as a series of permission slips to be whatever we are—sad, strange, content, alone, engaged, anything, nothing. Though she addresses “Love Who We Are Meant To” to an unnamed “you,” she sings it like a note to self, a reminder that it is better to be herself without the man who has left than to be disingenuous with him. Yes, they will see one another again, and she will surely run amok with feelings when they do—her voice is so careful here, over delicate fingerpicking and gossamer strings, that it suggests a dam straining to hold back a flood. But that’s OK, because it’s who she is right now.",59,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_58,2023,Late Night Love,Matthew Blackwell,"For the chronically anxious, thumping beats and writhing bodies can present an obstacle to transcendence, not a path to it. But for Octo Octa, who has been open about her own anxiety, the dancefloor is a balm. Her greatest skill as a producer is welcoming clubgoers of all dispositions into its communal space, and “Late Night Love” perfects her inviting style of house. A throbbing bass lures everyone onto the floor and a pounding kick drum keeps them there for the 12-minute ride, until celestial synths reveal their destination: not forward to the end of a sweaty night, but upward to an ecstatic climax. Octo Octa clears the way—all that’s left to do is ascend.",58,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_57,2023,eclipse de amor,Katherine St. Asaph,"“eclipse de amor” is fundamentally a bolero, and the Spanish electronic pop artist NOIA and Raquel Berrios of Buscabulla devastate as they grieve a love. Their vocals reflect this doomed affair’s impermanence; both singers navigate precise melodic lines, ending in trills that fray the melody thin. NOIA’s production makes the song modern, as horror-trailer SFX, sci-fi-console error pings, and a dembow riddim that bangs like a failing hard drive heighten the emotional wreckage.",57,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_56,2023,Speed Drive,Peyton Thomas,"“Speed Drive” flips Toni Basil’s pining cheerleader relic “Hey Mickey” on its head: Charli XCX wouldn’t dream of begging for a boy’s attention—this passenger princess only has eyes for the girl in the driver’s seat. Her bubblegum Barbie cut, which also samples Robyn’s “Cobrastyle,” is as light and fizzy as pink champagne as it celebrates young women’s vanity and intellect. (Charli shouts out both model Devon Lee Carlson and Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire on the song.) It’s the greatest celebration of love and friendship between thrill-seeking female motorists since Thelma & Louise.",56,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_55,2023,Gorilla,Dash Lewis,"Plenty of rappers can string together a mythmaking verse, but truly selling it takes the kind of swagger you can’t teach. On “Gorilla,” Little Simz exudes a detached cool, rapping with uncommon confidence. A horn fanfare builds hype—you can imagine Simz standing stone-faced, shouldering a championship belt—before shifting into a face-scrunching groove. It’s the type of classic bassline-and-breakbeat hip-hop that’s aged as beautifully as practical film effects. Simz oozes into the pocket, side-eyeing lesser rappers and fairweather fans when she’s not boasting about the depth of her skills and the futility of challenging them. She’s unbothered and in her lane, offering a masterclass in the subtle art of talking that shit.",55,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_54,2023,Red Wine Supernova,Amy Phillips,"The entire history of pop music is built on songwriters dreaming up poetic ways to convince hot people to sleep with them. Chappell Roan has no time for that. “You just told me/Want me to fuck you/Baby I will ’cause I really want to,” is just one of many delightfully direct come-ons peppering “Red Wine Supernova,” a horny, Sapphic highlight from her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess. Over strutting synth-pop, Roan showers the girl of her dreams in singalong hooks tailor-made for drunken karaoke nights. Subtlety is, like, so overrated.",54,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_53,2023,Bending Hectic,Laura Snapes,"The beauty of the slow-growing “Bending Hectic” is wrapped up in how Jonny Greenwood, Thom Yorke, and Tom Skinner make death and power seem equally, lavishly seductive. Is the song’s “vintage soft-top from the ’60s” careening off an Italian mountainside the hell-bound chariot of a doomed couple—or the last vestige of status belonging to a disgraced fat cat who’s going out swinging? It’s all rendered with such delicate romance. The way Greenwood’s arpeggios bend upward at the end of every line in the first half evokes the intoxication of a lover’s touch; Skinner’s drumming feels more like the fluttering of cilia. These airborne qualities parachute your heart up to your throat even before the terminal velocity of Yorke’s guitar, gnarled and striated as an ancient oak, signals absolution—or damnation.",53,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_52,2023,vampire,Jazz Monroe,"Olivia Rodrigo introduced her second album, GUTS, with a ballad-as-exorcism, her narrator shaking a past self free from an older partner’s sordid illusions. “vampire” pinballs between liberation, relitigation, and self-scrutiny, each verse a study in contrast: front-loaded with giddy, urgent exposition—the fucked-up thrills and diamond nights that he deluded her into viewing as a “forbidden paradise”—before recoiling into rueful couplets surveying the emotional damage. As on “drivers license,” Rodrigo vaults into an incendiary bridge, this time hinting at an appetite for revenge. But just as she seems primed for a scorched-earth assault, she reasserts control: The curtain drops, the music stops, and the fantasies created by this “fame fucker” finally shatter.",52,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_51,2023,Blackbox Life Recorder 21f,Dean Van Nguyen,"Aphex Twin’s first song in five years hums with gentle nostalgia, blurring at the edges like a happy memory that’s fading away. Dedicated to his late parents, “Blackbox Life Recorder 21f” begins mellow and summery, with much of the warmth and comfort of 2014’s Syro, seen through a softer filter. The bob-and-weave drum programming counters pretty synth melodies that float like celestial bodies. More elements eventually get stacked on—punchy breakbeats, crash cymbals in clusters—but the sentimentality at its core can’t be obscured.",51,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_50,2023,Psychedelic Switch,Peyton Toups,"You’d be forgiven if you thought Daft Punk reunited to produce “Psychedelic Switch,” the latest in Carly Rae Jepsen's growing collection of A-side-worthy B-sides. With synths strobing like Rainbow Road (or, you know, “One More Time”), Jepsen rides a euphoric ’70s bassline all the way to French-touch nirvana. As ever, the Canadian pop star is relatively coy about her desires, but it’s still charming to hear her “puttin’ on the ritz,” as she frames it, in 2023. You get the sense that even if her proverbial switch flips back off, this fleeting crush was worth the high.",50,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_49,2023,Spirit 2.0,Hannah Jocelyn,"The lead single from Sampha’s follow-up to 2017’s Process, “Spirit 2.0” is an airy journey toward enlightenment in which the singer finds transcendence in himself and his community. Starting with piano chords and arpeggiating Moog synths, the song swells into something luxurious but still light on its feet, as Sampha begins to effortlessly float over nimble percussion and sweeping strings. Switching flows and drawing out lines about “drifting into open skies,” he sounds freer than ever before.",49,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_48,2023,Installation,Will Pritchard,"A decade and change since the electronic producer Pangaea pulped UK clubland’s collective brain with the diced syllables and drunken percussion of “Hex,” he repeated the feat—but sweeter, sexier this time—with “Installation.” The tongue-juggling vocal chops are still front-and-center, but where “Hex” swirled around drum hits that seemed to disintegrate just as they reached your ears, “Installation” pumps a full-blooded Jersey house bounce through bubblegum-pop framing and demands a singalong—even if you’ve got no idea what the words are. I’m going with “eso es,” or Spanish for, “That’s it!”",48,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_47,2023,The Gods Must Be Crazy,Paul A. Thompson,"On We Buy Diabetic Test Strips, Armand Hammer’s constantly molting new album, phones are always intruding into the songs: landlines crackle and die, calls are blocked or dropped, and Siri is a harbinger of death. El-P’s beat for “The Gods Must Be Crazy” sounds like the uneasy fusion of data and flesh—in this case, human voices stripped from their bodies and collapsed into a rhythm that could double as a ringtone. Elucid and billy woods write about the fraught interconnectivity this motif suggests, the former wielding Xeroxed visas while the latter inches “to the edge of Earth/Sunburnt—black as Pompeii.” When woods later raps about “overlapping Venn diagrams overlapping,” the tenuousness of those connections is laid bare.",47,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_46,2023,Needs,Peyton Toups,"Sometimes, you just need dick. Tinashe doesn’t play coy about what she wants from a man on “Needs,” the no-frills, sex-positive standout from this year’s BB/ANG3L EP. Especially when coupled with a dynamic video full of freewheeling grocery-store choreography, the alt-R&B artist’s confidence in collecting simps is infectious. Reinforcing the idea that everyone has a reason to get some, “Needs” is ready to turn any Hinge-prone loner into a gleeful one-night stand.",46,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_45,2023,Younger & Dumber,Rachel Saywitz,"“Younger & Dumber” is a crowning anthem for empaths everywhere. Over chalky pedal steel and piano drenched in reverb, North Carolina indie rocker Indigo De Souza looks back on her own knotted history with glassy eyes. She appears reluctant to share at first, but then pushes to a desperate scream at the song’s climax. For De Souza, love of self offers more than a comforting embrace: It sits deep within bones, and when it leaves, it does so in a violent rush.",45,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_44,2023,Blissda,Brian Howe,"DJ Koze is widely hailed for the flashy eclecticism of his studio albums, but he’s also an ace club DJ, and “Blissda” distills the empathic bliss of his dancefloor genius into six heavenly minutes. It’s a dreaming deep-house moonrise: The melody drips like mercury falling from a dropper as it coats a slanting contraption of knocks, claps, and cymbals. The bass is more of a presence than a proper line, burning in smudge pots somewhere nearby. The perfectly titled track turns catharsis into a container—a little eternity in a chilled bottle.",44,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_43,2023,Mayors a Cop,Pete Tosiello,"The mayor of New York is a cop—an incontrovertible fact with damning implications. Rather than belabor the premise, NYC loyalists Wiki and MIKE use it to frame an experiential dialogue. Conditions include sweltering heat and slushy cold, skyrocketing rents and crumbling infrastructure; hemmed in on all sides, the rappers are left to assert their own personhood. “Mayors a Cop” is at once deliberate and meandering, with Wiki and MIKE exchanging wordy, emotive bars. Alchemist’s swirling horns evoke a military roll call, but the leaden tempo and muffled snare expose it for what it really is: a funeral dirge.",43,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_42,2023,Snowman,Joshua Minsoo Kim,"On the opener to Blonde Redhead’s first album in nine years, the dream-pop band remains as sly and playful with language as ever. A workmanlike beat lays the foundation for an elliptical chorus: “So like a no man that you are,” recites Amedeo Pace, the phrase later dissolving into the titular word. The music suggests a false sense of contentment: There are coos and yelps and beautiful harmonies, but any tenderness soon starts to feel mechanical. Love, the band implies, can leave you mired in doubt and insecurity—the elegant groove that keeps “Snowman” trudging along is ultimately the sound of stasis.",42,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_41,2023,Padam Padam,Jesse Dorris,"“We don’t need to use our words,” Kylie Minogue reminds us near the end of “Padam Padam.” The Australian pop lifer has long been an expert at the non- or barely-verbal: the la la la of “Can’t Get You Out of My Head,” the yeah yeah yeah of “All the Lovers.” And she just knew this heartless year called for more hearty onomatopoeia. Pumped up by producer Lostboy’s thumping bass and engorged whooshes, Kylie didn’t just give the gays and girlies a new pop standard, she gave us a secret code. We hear it and we know. Padam.",41,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_40,2023,Pinking Shears,Zhenzhen Yu,"“Pinking Shears” rattles with post-apocalyptic, post-punk aggression, but more than anything, Mandy, Indiana frontwoman Valentine Caulfield is exhausted. “J'suis fatiguée tu sais pas c'que j'suis fatiguée"" (“I'm tired, you don't know how tired I am”) she declares, full of despair, as she rails against militaries, corrupt politicians, and nations that allow refugees to die in unheated buildings. The Manchester band’s music unfolds piece by unnerving piece, mirroring Caulfield’s fatalistic cry into the void: unsettling electronic percussion interlocks with live drums before descending into sheets of seething, inhuman noise.",40,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_39,2023,dickhead blues,Jaeden Pinder,"Chicago singer-songwriter Kara Jackson spends most of “dickhead blues” sounding exasperated—that’s what dealing with an endless stream of, as she puts it, “losers who find themselves losing me” will do to a person. But it’s not about them. It’s about Jackson proclaiming her self-worth in the wake of so much nonsense. She wields her voice forcefully, first to hypnotize you, and then to slap you across the face with lucidity. “I am pretty top-notch,” she concludes, slowly and steadily learning to live for herself.",39,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_38,2023,Set the Roof,Shawn Reynaldo,"In a year when many DJs reached for edits of Y2K-era chart pop by the likes of Britney, Vengaboys, and t.A.T.u. whenever they needed to energize the dancefloor, Scottish vet Hudson Mohawke and Atlanta upstart Nikki Nair proved that an original banger could still take the club by storm. An irreverent continuation of dance music’s long-running transatlantic conversation, “Set the Roof” joyfully sits somewhere between UK garage and hip-house. But it’s the chipmunked vocals of Tayla Parx, whose sassy delivery recalls the days when Rye Rye was the hottest thing on the Hollerboard, that make the track such a sugary delight: Her maniacally looped phrasing can and will unlock the serotonin pathways of every raver in earshot.",38,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_37,2023,I’ve Got Me,Emma Madden,"Joanna Sternberg’s lamblike voice and air of cartoonish innocence may make their deeply felt songs seem lighter than they are at first, but that impression doesn’t last long. Desolation and quaintness coexist in “I’ve Got Me,” a jaunty ode to the relationships we have with ourselves. Its meaning is dependent on the emotional contours of those fraught bonds: Depending on the listener, the opening lines—“I’ve got me in the morning, I’ve got me in the evening”—could either be taken as a salve or a cause for concern. No matter who enters or departs your life, you’ll never be apart from yourself. And how comforting, or terrifying, is that?",37,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_36,2023,WICKED GYAL,Jesse Locke,"Over the past decade, the Toronto DJ BAMBII has brought a boundaryless, utopian spirit to her Jerk raves, smoothly merging club music with the cultures of the Caribbean diaspora. “WICKED GYAL,” from her debut EP, Infinity Club, furthers this concept, as UK MC Lady Lykez spits Jamaican patois over wobbly synths and skittering beats. Providing fair warning for her unruly behavior, Lykez belches into the mic and cautions that, with one wrong move, her hands might end up around your throat. The dancefloor beckons, but when she gets twisted, “anything goes.”",36,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_35,2023,Moonless,Quinn Moreland,"Julie Byrne’s “Moonless” is a staggering breakup ballad furnished with sparse, impressionistic details: an old hotel, smoke curling toward the ceiling, sea and sky blurring together in the night. By eschewing a straightforward narrative, “Moonless” captures the more ambiguous ways that a relationship erodes: What does the story matter, she asks, if absence looms so large? Set against a wandering piano melody and windswept strings, Byrne’s voice builds towards a quietly forceful declaration of autonomy: “I’m not waiting for your love.” It’s a reminder that from the ruins emerges a chance to rebuild.",35,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_34,2023,x w x,Jaeden Pinder,"yeule launches into their rock-star salvo softscars by tearing themselves apart from the inside out, like an Alien chestburster. Fusing their overtly digital sound with an affinity for ’90s alternative hooks and guitars, they expel their self-destructive habits—retail therapy, drug-induced numbness—with one of the most guttural, cleansing screams heard on record this year. It’s a nuclear kind of catharsis.",34,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_33,2023,For Granted,Gabriel Szatan,"All the way back to her debut 2017 EP, Yaeji projected presence with a hush—singing soft enough that the listener had little choice but to draw close. That same miniaturism leads off “For Granted,” as she half-whispers in English and Korean atop an elastic downtempo beat, with zero foreshadowing of anything untoward. But then: Years of probing doubt and gritted-teeth gratitude finally detonate, unleashing a cyclonic intensity that hurtles past breakbeat pop toward breakcore outright. Even while swinging anthropomorphic hammers overhead, Yaeji remains unflappable, her liquid intonation rising above the squall: “Let it floo-o-ow.” And how.",33,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_32,2023,Not Strong Enough,Heven Haile,"On “Not Strong Enough,” boygenius adopt the energy of Vacation Bible School dropouts who now find themselves wandering into random churches. Straddling the line between self-contempt and weaponized incompetence, they describe rotting away in their bedrooms and cowering from the people they love; they harmonize as though seeking courage from a higher power, giving the acoustic track the feel of a worship song. Near the end, Lucy Dacus beams through the melancholia: “I think I’ve been having revelations,” she exclaims, her rich vocals sounding like salvation amid an unrelenting universe.",32,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_31,2023,old place,Mehan Jayasuriya,"Here we have an incredible feat of alchemy that fuses seemingly every single one of London rapper-singer-producer Jim Legxacy’s disparate interests into 98 seconds of sublime pop music. “old place” feels like scrolling through a Zoomer’s TikTok feed: second-wave emo revivalism sits side-by-side with UK drill, Jersey club, and heartfelt R&B. The magic is in how effortlessly the song blends these sounds into an irresistible whole in service of Legxacy’s wistful nostalgia. “I know I probably shouldn’t take you back,” he croons at the outset, setting the clear-eyed yet lovelorn tone. In all, it proves that musical omnivorousness and efficient songwriting aren’t mutually exclusive.",31,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_30,2023,On My Mama,Clover Hope,"The centerpiece of an album that’s equally plush and splashy, “On My Mama” is a ritzy “feeling myself” moment decked in showy horns and a stalking bass that unfurls like a red carpet. Singing confidently over a retro Chalie Boy rap sample that’s like a cool uncle playing hype man, R&B virtuoso Victoria Monét has fun luxuriating in her own sex appeal, shit-talking and whispering sweet affirmations to herself. All she wants is a good time—and the “permanent ecstasy” she deserves.",30,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_29,2023,Three Drums,Patrick Lyons,"Four Tet just might be the most unlikely mainstream breakthrough star of the year. After spending the last two decades honing his luscious, humanistic take on dance music, he suddenly became a Coachella and Madison Square Garden headliner alongside buddies Fred Again.. and Skrillex, dishing out EDM euphoria to the masses. But “Three Drums,” released three days after the Coachella gig, has him back in classic mode. Stately and tranquil for its entire eight-minute run, it’s better suited for the ocean floor than the dancefloor. Turns out the same things that make him a fantastic party-starter—patient builds, detailed textures, pitch-perfect percussion—are also what make “Three Drums” so gripping on headphones.",29,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_28,2023,My Love Mine All Mine,Eric Torres,"The twilit centerpiece of Mitski’s The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We became a surprise phenomenon this year when its lullaby chorus grabbed hold on TikTok, lifting it to become her first-ever Hot 100 hit. With little more than a twangy guitar, piano, and her gentle voice, the snowglobe of a ballad is simple and to the point, with a poignant emotional center. It’s a perfect snapshot of the singer-songwriter’s wistful craftsmanship—tender-hearted and sharp-toothed—as she dedicates herself to the cosmos to ensure that the all-encompassing experience of loving, and having been loved, will endure for generations to come.",28,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_27,2023,Hollywood Baby,Mark Richardson,"On “Hollywood Baby,” Dylan Brady and Laura Les take the alt-rock crunch, pop-punk brattiness, and skate-kid rhyming that ruled the culture of their youth and supersize the living fuck out of it. The result is a chaotic pile-up with enough molten hooks and melodic ideas to power an album’s worth of songs, wrapped in a spangly package that demands an immediate test of your speakers’ volume limits.",27,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_26,2023,Barley,Madison Bloom,"Nate Amos and Rachel Brown, who record as the warped electronic duo Water From Your Eyes, compose with the sharp planes and severe angles of brutalist architects. “Barley” is a mass of meticulously placed protrusions: the clipped rhythm of a shaker that sounds packed with ice shards, synth bursts that twinkle like Mario leaping through a row of coins. What sets the pair apart from their noisemakering peers is their ability to amplify those extremes with cottony contrasting textures. Brown’s voice, temperate and deadpan, heightens the detuned bend of Amos’ guitar riffs, while husky bass fleshes out an arrangement spiked with high frequencies. The component parts of “Barley” shouldn’t necessarily work together, but the duo’s sneaky knack for pop melodies makes these serrated edges irresistible.",26,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_25,2023,"If I Don’t See You in the Future, I’ll See You in the Pasture",Jeremy D. Larson,"For the uninitiated, it may seem like Cole Pulice is simply leaning their forearm on all the white keys of an organ before wailing on a saxophone across this very long song. But what you are actually hearing is all saxophone, including its sound being manipulated through signal processing live in the studio by the Oakland-based electro-acoustic composer’s feet. The auditory illusion fits the mood of the piece: liminal, transitory, extremely trippy. Pulice saves the best for the end, when they repeat a squiggly little pitch-bendy riff over and over: As the production is stripped away, they intimately struggle with their altissimo register, like they’re trying to crawl back into the last 22 minutes of a dream slipping away from memory.",25,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_24,2023,Dreamliner,Rob Arcand,"Avalon Emerson shifts away from club music and toward pop on her debut album, but she doesn’t entirely abandon the sound that has made her a celebrated DJ across the last six years or so. On “Dreamliner,” she bridges the transition across the course of the track: Thumping kicks and stiffly sequenced arpeggios evoke the mechanical techno of her back catalog, but the dance groove gradually subsides, making space for a playful synth melody that carries the song’s second half. Through it all, her cool, muted vocals do double duty as both pointillist tone color and hummable melody—a reminder that, for a musician with the requisite vision and skills, you can, in fact, have it both ways.",24,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_23,2023,SkeeYee,Hattie Lindert,"No artist left less to the imagination this year than Sexyy Red, who broke out with a single called “Pound Town” and its extremely memorable opening declaration: “My coochie pink, my booty hole brown.” That blunt approach extends to “SkeeYee,” a summer anthem off the St. Louis rapper’s debut mixtape, Hood Hottest Princess, that’s now universal enough to have countless viral remixes and a place in Fat Joe’s vocabulary. Amid a bell-chiming beat, Red explains exactly what the song’s emphatic hook means: pull up! Turns out that’s a solid rallying cry. It’s also just really fun to say “skeeyee!”—especially when you’re supposed to be quiet. “Pound Town” may have established Red on the charts, but this is the song that distills her disruptive glee.",23,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_22,2023,Knockin,Andy Cush,"In the hard-luck world of MJ Lenderman, Bob Dylan isn’t the one singing “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.” It’s not Axl Rose or Warren Zevon, either. Instead, it’s John Daly, the pro golfer as well-known for getting drunk and fighting as he is for his championship victories. Lenderman’s reference to Daly in “Knockin” is funny, but it’s not merely a joke: The PGA’s tragic wildman knows as much about staring down darkness as any of those other guys. Over soaring pedal steel, Lenderman places his performance among other similarly bathetic scenes: a bird singing while trapped in a hardware store, a declaration of love whose speaker knows it’s hackneyed but delivers it anyway. The point is not to poke fun at the mundanity, but to exalt it.",22,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_21,2023,I Got Heaven,Maria Eberhart,"On “I Got Heaven,” Mannequin Pussy find salvation in rage. Marisa Dabice’s gritty screams rip the track open, as she condemns the religious powers that seek to judge and divide us in the bluntest of terms: “What if Jesus himself ate my fucking snatch?” But the song reveals sweeter sentiments in the Philadelphia band’s sparkly, shoegaze chorus, with Dabice championing the inherent worth inside of all of us. It’s a purifying song, a punk purge for the lapsed Christians still making sense of the institution that once defined them.",21,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_20,2023,Contact,Alphonse Pierre,"Is the dancefloor ever as transcendent as it sounds on “Contact”? Atop flickering breakbeats, Kelela makes you thirst for the kind of night when bodies blur and brush against one another until last call. With her weightless voice, she makes the club sound sensual and otherworldly, like none of your problems matter as long as you and your friends have a buzz and some bass going well after midnight.",20,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_19,2023,I Believe,Jane Bua,"Born from the holy trinity of an acid trip, grief, and Celine Dion, “I Believe” is a prismatic diva anthem dedicated to the late avant-pop pioneer SOPHIE. Robotic beeps punctuate a breakbeat, as Polachek’s voice gently cuts through the mix like a celestial strobe light. Her aerial runs spiral upwards, twisting until the song is suspended in mid-air: “I don’t know, but I believe/We’ll get another day together,” she attests over a church organ. It’s a transcendent moment of faith, a promise that Polachek will keep celebrating her friend in this life until they meet again in the next one.",19,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_18,2023,Pet Rock,Vanessa Ague,"The patterns in L’Rain’s music are constantly shifting and weaving, like a technicolor kaleidoscope. With “Pet Rock,” the Brooklyn-based multi-instrumentalist, whose work blends experimental and pop sounds into songs that take on themes of grief and identity, turns a tongue-in-cheek nod to the Strokes into a psychedelic reverie. Drums begin with a simple rhythm and get gradually wilder until they burst into a cascade of syncopations, while electric guitars wind and interlock. The component pieces may be familiar, but L’Rain’s ever-evolving combination of them is anything but.",18,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_17,2023,Year Zero,Ryan Dombal,"It’s the end of the world as we know it, and billy woods is feeling particularly nihilistic. The deadpan New York rap realist sounds like he’s burrowed into a bunker on this doomsaying spiral from Maps, his staggering album with the producer Kenny Segal. Bleak thoughts fester inside his skull. Living in the only country on Earth with more guns than people, he dreams up a nightmare in which there are “two unrelated active shooters—same place, same time.” The song’s most brutal gut punch, meanwhile, is a simple matter of fact: “My taxes pay police brutality settlements.” If woods is stewing underground in this dystopian hellscape, Danny Brown is commandeering an abandoned amusement park and reveling in the anarchy. Over queasy feedback that squeals like a zombie radio signal, Brown tosses off rhetorical bicycle kicks, rhymes Cool Runnings with Good Will Hunting, and cracks wise about out-of-service McDonald’s soft serve machines. Together, the two rappers conjure an apocalypse that’s as hopeless as it is hilarious, the cruelest possible joke.",17,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_16,2023,Co-Star,Jessica Kariisa,"Eschewing the “Afropop” pigeonhole, the Ghanaian-American artist Amaarae uses her roots as a muse rather than a constraint, allowing her music to shapeshift endlessly. “Co-Star” channels the sugar-coated sparkle of hyperpop and the millennial obsession with astrology over fast, syncopated drums that crackle like Pop Rocks. Depending on where you stand, you might also hear PinkPantheress, a little amapiano, or, in her catty sing-rapping, a nostalgic callback to Teeyah’s early aughts diaspora hit “Couper-décaler.” That fluidity is the secret ingredient of Amaarae’s star power: We might know where she comes from but we’ll never know where she’s going.",16,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_15,2023,Vampire Empire,Marc Hogan,"For Big Thief, 2023 counted as a quiet year. No new album—let alone a double album, or a pair of albums—just a lone 7” single. But what a single. On this rough-and-ready studio recording of live favorite “Vampire Empire,” Adrienne Lenker’s deep sensitivity to everything around her is at its most finely tuned. Atop ragged folk-rock, she spills forth about sex that transcends gender and drugs that don’t work, embracing and then escaping her demons in a whirlwind plunge.",15,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_14,2023,The Hillbillies,Matthew Strauss,"It’s nice to see Kendrick having fun again. On “The Hillbillies,” atop bright Jersey club drums and a Bon Iver sample, the rapper and his cousin Baby Keem ride a jangling beat as they battle for the best one-liners. Lamar sets the tone, spouting off about getting “four McDonald’s”—that is, probably, $4 million—“every time I land, bro,” while Keem responds with his own goofy flex about liking “irregular girls.” Their natural chemistry is off-the-charts and addictive, like watching two All-Stars scoring style points instead of trying to win the game.",14,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_13,2023,Shiver,Puja Patel,"Lust is a battlefield and Karin Dreijer is sweeping for mines. As they wade through the muck of desire, a synth-horn swells into a siren warning of danger ahead; sinister drums echo back and forth in anticipation, the air becomes thick with electricity. “Shiver” is so magnetic, so precise in drawing the dizzying shape of a fantasy, that it makes having a crush sound like an affliction. It could all change with just one more hang, just a little touch. By the time they’ve gathered the courage, a terrifying thought takes hold: Can I trust you?",13,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_12,2023,It Must Change,Shaad D’Souza,"Seven years ago, ANOHNI cast modern society as a font of pure hopelessness. But on “It Must Change,” she suggests even the most oppositional forces are mutable. “You know how they always said that light is the opposite of darkness?” she asks. “It’s just fire in darkness…/ So those opposites, they don’t exist.” With these lines, the demand of the song’s title turns into an olive branch, as if she’s reaching beyond any one listener to a greater cause. Her voice surges above production that harks back to classic-era Motown and Muscle Shoals, tapping into what may be the last remaining universal human truth: We’re all just trying to survive.",12,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_11,2023,Daddy,Evan Minsker,"“Daddy” deserves a place in the grand pantheon of sad bangers. Over a deeply danceable house thump, Nourished by Time’s Marcus Brown croons his hook with the confidence of an ’80s R&B lothario. But there’s a palpable longing at the heart of this song’s club euphoria. Created in his parents’ basement—with an equally great live version filmed in their cluttered garage—the track includes raps about not being able to compete with a lover’s sugar daddy. There’s a displaced giddiness to the song’s sped-up vocal promise that he’ll never be alone, especially as Brown delivers the killshot: “I say, ‘I love you’/You say, ‘Whatever.’”",11,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_10,2023,Making the Band (Danity Kane),Matthew Ritchie,"“Making the Band (Danity Kane)” is a swift shattering of every preconceived notion of what an Earl Sweatshirt song sounds like. Gone are the magnetically morose raps laid over dusty soul loops. Instead, as Evilgiane and Clams Casino’s chattering, anti-gravity production churns behind him, Earl expertly navigates an alien landscape, sounding newly invigorated. His quotables about MTV-era pop stars and the Incredible Hulk feel akin to proverbs, and lines about dancing in the rain and cracking bank safes come off as keys to enlightenment. Where Earl’s music was once ruled by murkiness and confusion, he’s now crystal clear—if only for a couple of minutes.",10,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_9,2023,Rush,Jamieson Cox,"Reeling from the one-two punch of a breakup and a lockdown, Troye Sivan sought solace in Melbourne’s gay bars: sweaty clubs, cold beer, love affairs that start after dark and end by sunrise. The pop star captures those endless evenings on “Rush,” a song that could easily soundtrack the best night of your life, from its chaotic opening to a hook chanted by your friendly neighborhood rugby team hunks. While the fluidity and frankness of “Rush” is bracing, the song’s sensuality and confidence finds Sivan in conversation with like-minded icons of decades past: consider Janet Jackson circa “Together Again,” or George Michael looking for “Fastlove.” Spinning personal anguish into liquid honey has yielded the singer’s most timeless work yet—a reminder that pain may be temporary, but poppers are forever.",9,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_8,2023,Chosen to Deserve,Cat Zhang,"The love of your life is a dirtbag who skipped school, pissed in the street, and bummed around with dumbass friends who chugged Benadryl like PBRs—and she’s perfect, baby. Part down-home devotional, part miscreant’s statement of purpose, Wednesday’s “Chosen to Deserve” is a country-rock slammer where frontwoman Karly Hartzman confesses her unsavory past to her partner, proceeding with faith that when the story’s over, he’ll still be smiling. “We always started by tellin’ all our best stories first/So now that it's been awhile, I'll get around/To tellin’ you all my worst,” she begins. A casually observant Jewish girl raised in the Bible thumping South, Hartzman appropriates the language of predestination to deliver one of the most romantic tributes of the year, a wide-open love song that proves that everyone, no matter how fucked up, is a miracle to someone.",8,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_7,2023,Super Shy,Olivia Horn,"Zero-to-hero anthem “Super Shy” is the daydream wafting through the mind of an overlooked heroine while she eyes the most popular boy in school. Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein exude quiet confidence as they plot to catch a cutie by surprise. Built around a riff on the Powerpuff Girls theme and a bass drum like a hiccuping heartbeat, the song was co-written by Erika de Casier, who expertly guides the group towards a soft, sensitive take on drum’n’bass. Embedded in its message of demure power is a sliver of meta-commentary on NewJeans’ approach: More sonically understated than many of their K-pop contemporaries, they have quickly become chart titans nonetheless. “You don’t even know my name, do you?” the girls ask impishly on the hook. The “but you will” is implied.",7,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_6,2023,Kill Bill,Jenn Pelly,"With her wrenching self-examination, SZA’s songwriting encourages the kind of deep emotional inquiry that, as with all the greats, helps us understand ourselves better. Not so much (one hopes) on the murderous “Kill Bill.” At the start of SOS’s fierce stylistic melange, this inescapable boom-bap thriller instantly revealed the singer’s morbid humor and the range of her pen; it’s SZA gone full auteur. Playing the villain, she crafts her allegorical single in the spirit of murder ballads and action films, fantasizing, in the uncannily cool-headed chorus, about the most extreme revenge imaginable against a boyfriend who’s moved on. Her hard-boiled extravagance and acute psychological attunement might just kill the ex living in your head. Yet it’s her drolly disarming boasts—“I got me a therapist,” “I did all of this sober”—that suggest what really drives the song’s deathly fiction: SZA’s own bid for self-preservation.",6,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_5,2023,get him back!,Arielle Gordon,"One way or another, Olivia Rodrigo is gonna get ya. On the deliriously fun third single from her second album GUTS, she rattles off an ex’s red flags with an amused detachment that channels the Waitresses’ Patty Donahue and Blondie’s Debbie Harry. Over a fuzzy three-chord melody, Rodrigo waxes vindictive on the song title’s double meaning, conjuring alternately violent and reconciliatory fantasies that her therapist father (who gets a shout-out!) might attribute to “anxious attachment.” “get him back!” quite literally sounds like the contrasting highs and lows of Rodrigo’s warring impulses, her voice taking on the quality of a school bully on the song’s rapped verses and a bubbly cheerleader on its exuberant choruses. The quiet-loud dynamic culminates in a final whispered bridge, which sends the frenetic peak of the song’s last chorus into orbit. From its false start to Rodrigo’s devilish final laugh, “get him back!” is as messy, flawed, and ultimately freeing as a breakup feels.",5,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_4,2023,Namesake,Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Noname isn’t afraid to delve into the messiness of making art with a global consciousness while toiling within a capitalist economy. On “Namesake,” she laments the pervasiveness of complacency, admits we’re all complicit, and rails against war crimes from inside a cloud of blunt smoke. Over a percolating funk beat, Noname calmly eviscerates the very concept of sacred cows, adopting a faux-cheerleader lilt as she connects the dots between Super Bowl headliners Beyoncé, Kendrick, and Rihanna, and the NFL’s longtime association with the military industrial complex. In the next breath, she calls out the woman in the mirror for playing Coachella after she said she wouldn’t. “Namesake” is a ruthless song about accountability from which no one is safe—not even Noname.",4,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_3,2023,Will Anybody Ever Love Me?,Ryan Dombal,"The question at the center of this song is the same one Sufjan Stevens has been asking in his music for the last 20 years, though he’s never been quite this direct about it. It’s easy to understand why: His trembling whisper of a voice and the way he can make the pluck of an acoustic guitar ring out like the loneliest sound ever created are instantly devastating on their own, so cutting them with poetic storytelling and elaborate arrangements can feel both merciful and necessary. But “Will Anybody Ever Love Me?” is pure, undiluted, raw—the kind of song that makes your face crinkle up before a single word is sung. Casually tossing the song into the “sad” pile and waiting for it to soundtrack your next breakup doesn’t do it justice. Though Stevens begins the song on his own, lamenting alongside a fingerpicked guitalin, he’s soon joined by a chorus of background singers who offer much-needed consolation. And while the love he longs for may be the romantic kind, with verses that dream of funeral pyres and golden blades, there could be something bigger and more mysterious at play: Is it God’s love that he’s after? At 48, Stevens knows that answering these kinds of questions doesn’t get any easier. But simply saying them aloud carries its own power.",3,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_2,2023,Boy’s a liar Pt. 2,Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,"The boy in question was never the point. On this star-making TikTok megahit—a bubbly fusion of Jersey Club and the sounds of Super Nintendo—Gen Z’s most beloved pop/rap princesses don’t actually seem to care that much about some dude’s mendacity: PinkPantheress assesses her situationship in a sing-songy chirp, while Ice Spice raps well-argued rhetoric about a bro’s sad two-timing, making it very clear that she knows he's not worth her time. What ""Boy's a liar Pt. 2"" is really about is how much fun it is to bitch with your friends. In the video, the sparkling duo and their pink-clad posse own the streets and subways of New York, a vision of baddies in need of nothing but each other, turning a track about a trifling boy into the ultimate declaration of girl friendship.",2,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
2023_1,2023,A&W,Anna Gaca,"“American whore” sounds almost like “American woman,” and I’ll tell you how often people say one to mean the other. Picture vintage 2012 Lana in the Budweiser T-shirt. “Ride” was her bid for total freedom and she prefaced it with a monologue about what that meant: broken dreams, the open road, and being the other woman, the one with no attachments. On “A&W,” co-written with Jack Antonoff, she approaches her destination with a seven-minute autofiction epic that breaks like a storm cloud over Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd. Lana seeks the source of her ill humors and speaks of lost youth, a distant mother, predation, addiction, and desperate, toxic validation. Little rivulets of piano trickle through the melody, wearing out the paint. Hear her sing the word “raped” with the same polite trepidation they’ll use to suggest that she asked for it: No point explaining, she knows what they’d call her. Her exposition is its own kind of dark comedy, like, I know the app says I’m in Rosemead—can you come to my hotel room? Lana can be tender but the American whore is ice cold, smiling: She challenges us to ask how she ended up here and the answer is defensive and unsatisfying. She knows that being bad feels amazing—delirious, sharp like new money, concussive like the riptide bass that sucks us into the song’s furious, twisted fantasy denouement. “Surf’s up!” When the switch flips it’s Lana’s script, The Experience of Being an American Whore, one of those trendy youth dramas full of sex, drugs, and Cocoa Puffs. And here’s mystery Jimmy, the habit that uses her back. Doesn’t the melody sound like it’s spiraling? The perfect victim is silent so Lana becomes loud, stubborn, unbreakable. She’s got a “your mom” joke that’s gonna stop his heart: What if I told her everything?",1,The 100 Best Songs of 2023,Pitchfork
